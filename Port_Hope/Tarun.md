Player: hi  
Tarun: Greetigs!  
Player: name  
Tarun: My name is Taun.  
Player: job  
Tarun: I'm a merchant. I trade in spices, silk, jewelry and ivory. I traveled along the trade routes between Port Hope and Darashia together with my brother. But these times are over, I far.  
Player: merchant  
Tarun: I maintain a small caravan to transport my goods between the cities of Darashia and Port Hope. It is even smaller now, as one of the rather greedy members stayed in the Kha'Zeel Mountans.  
Player: greedy  
Tarun: Yes, there are rumours about countless treasures, hidden in the dragon lairs there. I warned my fellow not to disturb these dangerous creatures out of simple avarice, but just like my brother, he wouldn't listen tome.  
Player: brother  
Tarun: My brother is missing. I fear, he went to this evil palace north of here. A place of great beauty, certainly filled with riches and luxury. But in truth it is a threshold to hell and demonesses are after his blood....  
Tarun: He is my brother, and I am deeply ashamed to admit but I don't dare to go there. Perhaps your heart is more courageous than mine. Would you go to see this place and search for my broter?  
Player: yes  
Tarun: I thank you! This is more than I could hpe!  
Player: hi  
Tarun: Greetigs!  
Player: mission  
Tarun: So, he is dead as I feared. I warned him to go with this woman, but he gave in to temptation. My heart darkens and moans. But you have my sincere thanks....  
Tarun: Without your help I would have stayed in the dark about his fate. Please, take this as a little recompese.  
Player: hi  
Tarun: Greetigs!  
Player: bye  
Tarun: Farewell.
