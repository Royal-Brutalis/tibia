Player: hi  
Ray: Hello. How may I help you Player? Ask me for a trade if you want to buy something. I can also explain the mail system.  
Player: job  
Ray: I am responsible for this post office. If you have questions about the mail system or the depots, just ask me.  
Player: name  
Ray: My name is Ray.  
Player: time  
Ray: Now it's 10:50 am.  
Player: dworcs  
Ray: Those bloodthirsty headhunters live in the south. I heard only horrible stories about them and I believe they are not exaggerated.  
Player: jungle  
Ray: The jungle is a dangerous place. Many got lost there and never returned.  
Player: apes  
Ray: They are a pest. A quite dangerous pest as far as I can tell.  
Player: lizards  
Ray: The lizards give me shivers. They are so alien, even more than the minotaurs or orcs we know from the surroundings of Thais.  
Player: thais/carlin  
Ray: All cities are covered by our mailing system.  
Player: ferumbras  
Ray: I hope this colony is too remote and meaningless to him to care for a visit.  
Player: excalibug  
Ray: There are rumours about some hidden stone tablets mentioning that weapon. Adventurers claim to have seen those tablets in the ancient lizard city.  
Player: post/mail  
Ray: With our mail system you can send letters and parcels to other Tibians. I can either explain how letters and parcels work or sell them to you if you ask me for a trade.  
Player: king tibianus  
Ray: The king lives far away in the lovely city of Thais, but even he can be reached by our mailing system.  
Player: bye  
Ray: I hope to see you back soon, Player.
