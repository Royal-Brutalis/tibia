Player: hi  
Yana: Blessings, Player! How may I help you? Do you wish to trade some tokens, or do you need some information?  
Player: information  
Yana: Tokens are small objects made of metal or other materials. You can use them to buy superior equipment from token traders like me.  
Yana: There are several ways to obtain the tokens I'm interested in - killing certain bosses, for example. In exchange for a certain amount of tokens, I can offer you some first-class items.  
Player: token  
Yana: If you have any gold tokens with you, let's have a look! Maybe I can offer you something in exchange.  
Player: gold  
Yana: Here's the deal, Player. For 100 of your gold tokens, I can offer you some special equipment pieces which you can charge with a certain item type. I have the following item types to offer: mayhem, remedy or carving. ...  
Yana: I may also give you a short description what these labels mean. So, which item type are you most interested in?  
Player: description  
Yana: A weapon of mayhem increases your chance to hit harder and to enhance the damage you inflict. A weapon of remedy gives you a certain chance to gain a part of a creature's life energy for yourself. ...  
Yana: And a weapon of carving does the same with a creature's mana.  
Player: bye  
Yana: Farewell, Player.
