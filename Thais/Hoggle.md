Player: Hi  
Hoggle: Welcome to my humble home!  
Player: Job  
Hoggle: I am just a poor fisherman.  
Player: Fisherman  
Hoggle: It's a very hard job, cause without a boat I have to swim and fish at the same time!  
Player: Fish  
Hoggle: I think they can talk, but they are wise enough to be silent. Once I saw a mermaid.  
Player: Mermaid  
Hoggle: I saw one! She had the body of a fish, and also the head of a fish. Amazing!  
Player: Mountain  
Hoggle: Yes, there is a mountain to the north, but it's of no interest. There isn't any fish on it.  
Player: Map  
Hoggle: If you go north-west you will find Lubo and his adventurer shop. I think he sells maps.  
Player: Name  
Hoggle: I am Hoggle. I live in this house.  
Player: Time  
Hoggle: No, it's not time now to go fishing.  
Player: Carlin  
Hoggle: There are stories about a city behind the mountain, but why should I go there? There is enough fish here.  
Player: Thais  
Hoggle: I know this city. Sometimes I sell fish to Frodo.  
Player: Frodo  
Hoggle: He buys my fish.  
Player: Bye  
Hoggle: Good bye.
