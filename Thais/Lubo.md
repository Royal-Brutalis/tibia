Player: Hi  
Lubo: Welcome to my adventurer shop, Player! What do you need?  
Player: Job  
Lubo: I am selling equipment for adventurers. Do you need anything?  
Player: Equipment  
Lubo: I sell torches, fishing rods, ropes, water hoses, backpacks, apples, and maps.  
Player: Maps  
Lubo: Oh! I'm sorry, I sold the last one just five minutes ago.  
Player: Magic  
Lubo: There's a lot of magic flowing in the mountain to the north.  
Player: Name  
Lubo: I am Lubo, the owner of this shop.  
Player: Time  
Lubo: It is exactly 0:00 am.  
Player: Weapon  
Lubo: If you want to buy weapons, you'll have to go to a town or city.  
Player: Mountains  
Lubo: It is said that once there lived a great magician on the top of this mountain.  
Player: Magician  
Lubo: I don't remember his name, but it's said that his banner was the black eye.  
Player: Crunor's Cottage  
Lubo: Ah yes, I remember my grandfather talking about that name. This house used to be an inn a long time ago. My family bought it from some of these flower guys.  
Player: Flower guys  
Lubo: Oh, I mean druids of course. They sold the cottage to my family after some of them died in an accident or something like that.Player: Accident  
Lubo: As far as I can remember the story, a pet escaped its stable behind the inn. It got somehow involved with powerful magic at a ritual and was transformed in some way.  
Player: Stable  
Lubo: My grandpa told me, in the old days there were some behind this cottage. Nothing big though, just small ones, for chicken or rabbits.
