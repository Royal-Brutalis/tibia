Player: hi  
Markwin: Oh its you again. What do you want, hornless messenger?  
Player: job  
Markwin: I am the king of all minotaurs. I have been the king for more than 320 years.  
Player: king  
Markwin: I am the real king!  
Player: Mintwallin  
Markwin: The former glorious city lies in the dirt. It is my home. I founded it about 180 years ago, when we found this lovely place.  
Player: place  
Markwin: Na! You will have to find it yourself!  
Player: prisoner  
Markwin: He is totally mad. I don't know how he could find the way through the labyrinth. I arrested him in the prison.  
Player: human  
Markwin: I hate them all. Minotaurs have no own spelling, so I used the speech of the humans. Once I was a prisoner of them. Since then I hate them - and since then I can speak and write in their language.  
Player: time  
Markwin: Don't ask me such stupid questions. My time is over right now.  
Player: Palkar  
Markwin: He is the leader of the outcast. In former times he was my best warrior, but now he is my worst enemy.  
Player: secret laboratory  
Markwin: Hehe - you will never find a way to enter it. The outcast stole the key. You are too weak to conquer it. HARHARHAR.  
Player: outcasts  
Markwin: Those are no minos any longer. They left the city and killed their brothers. And they stole the key to my secret lab.  
Player: key  
Markwin: There are many keys. The outcast stole the key to our secret lab! They should burn!  
Player: enter  
Markwin: To enter the laboratory is pretty difficult.  
Player: enter the laboratory  
Markwin: First of all you will need a second fellow to help you.  
Player: second fellow  
Markwin: Yeah - he has to step on a special tile and an entrance will appear at a very poisonous place!  
Player: second  
Markwin: After you entered the first area you will need the key from the outcasts.  
Player: poisonous place  
Markwin: Na! You will have to find it yourself!  
Player: demon  
Markwin: He was the beginning of our end. He is mighty and powerful. He killed many brave minos and after his arrival we weren't able to go up to the surface.  
Player: milk  
Markwin: No! I won't tell you the powers of our milk!  
Player: books  
Markwin: I am one of the minotaurs that are able to write. So I wrote most of the history of my beloved city Mintwallin in some books.  
Player: bye  
Markwin: Hm ... good bye.
