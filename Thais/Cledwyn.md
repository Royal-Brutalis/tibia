Player: hi  
Cledwyn: Blessings, Player! How may I be of service? Do you wish to trade some tokens, or would you like some information or talk?  
Player: information  
Cledwyn: With pleasure. <bows> I trade tokens. There are several ways to obtain the tokens I am interested in - killing certain bosses, for example. In exchange for a certain amount of tokens, I can offer you some first-class items.  
Player: token  
Cledwyn: If you have any silver tokens with you, let's have a look! Maybe I can offer you something in exchange.  
Player: silver  
Cledwyn: Here's the deal, Player. For 100 of your silver tokens, I can offer you some first-class torso armor. These armors provide a solid boost to your main attack skill, as well as ...  
Cledwyn: some elemental protection of your choice! So, which skill type are you most interested in: sword, axe, club, distance or magic level?  
Player: talk  
Cledwyn: Why, certainly! I'm always up for some small talk. ...  
Cledwyn: The weather continues just fine here, don't you think? Just the day for a little walk around the town! ...  
Cledwyn: Actually, I haven't been around much yet, but I'm looking forward to exploring the city once I've finished trading tokens.  
Player: name  
Cledwyn: <bows> Cledwyn O'Reilly, bespoke smith and token trader, at your service.  
Player: job  
Cledwyn: Well, I'm a smith by trade, but my passion is to collect rare tokens made of metal or gemstones. It's something of a family trait. ...  
Cledwyn: All of my family have a passion for some precious stone or metal, but as we're craftsmen, not warriors, we prefer to trade for what we want. ...  
Cledwyn: At the moment, I'm rather interested in silver tokens. ...  
Cledwyn: If you should happen to have any with you, I'll forge you a first-class armour in return for 100 of 'em.  
Player: bye  
Cledwyn: Make your own destiny, Player.
