Player: hi  
Brutus The Baker: Hi there player. I guess you are here to assist me in my job!  
Player: job  
Brutus The Baker: I'm a member of the Magic Bakery Alliance. We are an order that is dedicated to further the knowledge of bakery for the benefit of mankind. Our goals are as numerous as the recipes we come up with each season.  
Player: goals  
Brutus The Baker: Currently we are trying to reclaim another part of Kullu's wisdom. Year after year, we try our best to break the defences of Cake Keep Isle.  
Player: Kullu  
Brutus The Baker: He was a great mage but an even greater cook. His recipes and spells are priceless. Sadly, even if we succeed in breaking the defences of Cake Keep Isle, we will only manage to decipher a tiny fraction of his knowledge. ...  
Brutus The Baker: And still, we don't know what happened to Kullu. He retreated from our world to fully concentrate on his research on cooking recipes and spells. ...  
Brutus The Baker: He was some sweet tooth for all that we know. And for sure a genius when it comes to baking and magic. ...  
Brutus The Baker: His kitchen magic was that amazing, you could not tell where baking ended and magic started.  
Player: reclaim  
Brutus The Baker: Now we are on Kullu's cake isle. We can gather some of his secrets before the isle will vanish again. But we won't be able to experiment with the secrets ...  
Brutus The Baker: That is, unless you are willing to help us in this matter!  
Player: keep  
Brutus The Baker: To be undisturbed, he placed his keep on an isle that existed on a planar instability which allowed him to phase the isle out of existence for most of the time. ...  
Brutus The Baker: Additionally, he surrounded the isle with a sorcery of his invention that defied most attempts to reach it. ...  
Brutus The Baker: It took us quite a while to figure out that he'd never be able to weave a protection spell against something he loved so dearly like cakes and bakery wares. ...  
Brutus The Baker: So we came up with the idea of the bridge.  
Player: bridge  
Brutus The Baker: After a few failed attempts with gingerbread boats and the like, we figured out how to reach Cake Keep Isle. We used the very ingredients we could derive from his cake golem attacks to build a stable cake bridge to his isle.  
Player: chance  
Brutus The Baker: The golems that raid the cities supply us with two major materials that we need to build our bridge to Cake Keep Isle. ...  
Brutus The Baker: One component is the sugary mass that can be gained if you slay one of them. We use it as a kind of mortar. ...  
Brutus The Baker: The second part is a bit trickier to get. It is the raw cake material. It is kind of challenging to gain it. We built extraction machines that can drain the base material from the still animated corpses. ...  
Brutus The Baker: We placed one in each of the raided cities. You will have to lure the golems into the machines, to extract the material from them. ...  
Brutus The Baker: We need it to have a stable base material that is resilient against wind, weather and salt water.  
Player: help  
Brutus The Baker: Yes, yes! Just step somewhere on the cakes base on the isle. Then travel to one of our ingredient extractors at Thais, Carlin, Darashia, Liberty Bay and Edron. ...  
Brutus The Baker: They will extract the cake mass that is stuck on you. So if you want to feed another extractor you'll have to visit the isle again of course. ...  
Brutus The Baker: If you manage to feed all five extractors before the time runs out I will give you a special reward.  
Player: reward  
Brutus The Baker: Well, not all our experiments with Kullu's recipes went well. But even the failures are good for something. We used them to create some beautiful as well as practical pieces of furniture, storage and decoration. ...  
Brutus The Baker: If you are interested - and have fed all five extractors with cake mass that is stuck on you -, I can hand you one.  
Player: one  
Brutus The Baker: I have a choice of three rewards. Tell me which one you want: a cake cabinet, a cake backpack or a cake tapestry?  
Player: Magic Bakery Alliance  
Brutus The Baker: We are a mystic order of bakers who pursue goals for the benefit of all mankind. Don't even listen to the lies and propaganda spread by those who envy us.  
Player: order  
Brutus The Baker: We are a mystic baker order. Don't listen to those who envy us and spread ugly lies and propaganda. We are dedicated to uncover the greatest secrets about cooking and baking. ...  
Brutus The Baker: Baking is the only trade worth to be considered. Without bakers everyone would starve. We are what ties a society together, preferably with a thick, sticky and sweet mass made of fruits. ...  
Brutus The Baker: We are the momentum of culture. Baking is what divides civilization from barbarism.  
Player: lies  
Brutus The Baker: Though most of our noble order abandoned the more theoretical studies at the academies, it is an evil lie that we are failed students who know more about drinking and eating than about magic. ...  
Brutus The Baker: Once we have revealed all of Kullu's secrets, we will be envied by all. And of course we all will become famous and incredibly rich.  
Player: name  
Brutus The Baker: I am Brutus. Brutus the baker, that is.  
Player: isle  
Brutus The Baker: Now that the isle is conquered, we can search for Kullu's secrets, at least for a while.  
Player: bye  
Brutus The Baker: Good bye.
