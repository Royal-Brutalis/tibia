Player: 'Hi  
Minzy: Welcome. Good you're showing up  
Player: Showing up / Job  
Minzy: I've never considered to follow a profession. But people tend to call me a swamp witch because I sometimes make brews with unusual ingredients in my cauldron. So I guess that is what I am.  
Player: Witch  
Minzy: Not all witches are evil. Neither do all of us fit into such simple categories like good and evil at all. ...  
Minzy: In these days, several of us work for a common cause and put our differences aside for a greater goal. ...  
Minzy: I think there is a lot to learn from this and I hope it will somehow be an inspiration for others.  
Player: Brews  
Minzy: The brew is not ready by far. We are just beginning and there is much left to be done.  
Player: Ingredients  
Minzy: We need the ingredients and we need many of them. We gather supplies the whole year and prepare most of the brew in advance. ...  
Minzy: But with our numbers dwindling, we need more and more help of the Tibians to save the world. You might gain our favour by helping us in our mission.  
Player: 'Cauldron  
Minzy: The cauldron is ancient and sacred to us. It bears powerful enchantments and years of use in rituals have changed its very structure in the fabric of reality.  
Player: Brew  
Minzy: The brew is not ready by far. We are just beginning and there is much left to be done.  
Player: Favour  
Minzy: By sacrificing items for our cause or igniting the cauldron's fire you will gain some favour within our circle. ...  
Minzy: We are willing to trade certain potions to you. Your current favour is 2.  
Player: Trade  
Minzy: We offer mana potions, strong mana potions and great mana potions. We also offer health potions, strong health potions, great health potions and ultimate health potions. And we offer great spirit potions.  
Player: Mana potions  
Minzy: Sorry, your favour is not high enough.  
Player: Name  
Minzy: I am known as Minzy.  
Player: Banebringer  
Minzy: We have to hold the ritual in these days when they are strongest. They might even manifest now and then harass us in our ritual with the help of rotten dead things . ...  
Minzy: But this is nothing compared to their wrath if we should fail the ritual. We would have to wait a whole year to try a new ritual and had to endure the malignant attacks of the bane bringers in the meantime.  
Player: Attacks  
Minzy: The bane bringers work in a very subtle way. You might lose connection to a dear friend, have considerable streaks of bad luck or make new enemies. ...  
Minzy: Perhaps they'd let something of your possession vanish or make you look like a cheater or liar through some strange coincidence. The worst thing they do is eating away your luck and happiness though.  
Player: Venore  
Minzy: One would guess the trade barons could easily spare the ingredients for the brew, but they won't lift a finger and call us superstitious fools. ...  
Minzy: In the past, they even sent mercenaries to disrupt our ritual but our resistance proved too expensive for their tastes. Still, we failed to complete the ritual that year and many suffered.  
Player: Magic  
Minzy: I won't share my knowledge with strangers. Besides, there is little I know that would be of any practical use at all for you.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Minzy: He has stolen much of his knowledge from several sources. The community of witches suffered particularly from his greed. ...  
Minzy: We will not forget this. Although, some misguided souls sell themselves to him for some of the stolen and now lost knowledge in return.  
Player: Excalibug  
Minzy: Weapons, weapons. Is this all you people care about? The bane bringer threat is a far more imminent event. This should be our focus.  
Player: Bye  
Minzy: Take care my friend.
