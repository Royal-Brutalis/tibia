Player: hi  
Hugo: Be greeted, player and welcome to the 'wearhouse'!  
Player: job  
Hugo: I am tailor and designer extraordinaire. Well, rather a designer. I leave most of the actual tailoring to my assistants.  
Player: name  
Hugo: I am known as Hugo Chief.  
Player: time  
Hugo: Sorry, a watch would ruin my stylish outfit.  
Player: hugo  
Hugo: Well it's not my real name. I took it because people think it's scaring and manly. I hate people doubting my manhood for being a tailor, you know.  
Player: real name  
Hugo: Uhm, well it's Oscar Savage, but who can become famous, especially as an artist, with a name like that I ask you?  
Player: outfit  
Hugo: Sorry, but my time is currently reserved for premium matters.  
Player: warehouse  
Hugo: I would call it a 'wearhouse'.  
Player: 'thais  
Hugo: Thais is kind of a fashion hell. If there was an award for the most ugly citizens, it would go to Thais.  
Player: carlin  
Hugo: Women should know better than to hide in ugly armor. Like all followers of ugliness they will be punished one day.  
Player: king  
Hugo: He does not care much about us, we don't care much about him. I consider that a fair deal.  
Player: excalibug  
Hugo: I don't care for such fairytales.  
Player: ferumbras  
Hugo: The ferumbras-bad-ass-fashion is incredibly outdated since years.  
Player: bye  
Hugo: Good bye, player.
