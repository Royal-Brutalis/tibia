Player: Hi  
Xed: Greetings, Player. Welcome to the distance fighting booth of the Ironhouse where you can buy bows, crossbows and ammunition.  
Player: Ammunition/Arrow/Bolt  
Xed: I sell arrows for bows and bolts for crossbows. Ask me for a trade if you're interested to see my wares.  
Player: Distance  
Xed: Well, I sell spears, bows, crossbows and ammunition for distance fighting. Ask me for a trade if you're interested to see my wares.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Xed: I heard rumours somewhere that his father was called Hugo.  
Player: Job  
Xed: I am the humble supplier for distance fighting weapons of the Ironhouse, owned by Abran Ironeye.  
Player: Name  
Xed: People call me Xed, but my full name is Xedem.  
Player: Time  
Xed: I don't know, maybe what you really need is a watch.  
Player: Weapon  
Xed: My offers are bows, crossbows and ammunition. If you'd like to see my offers, ask me for a trade.  
Player: Xed  
Xed: Yeah, nice name, eh?  
Player: Abran Ironeye  
Xed: He is the owner of this market, although - just between you and me - I'm not so sure he's honest.  
Player: Honest  
Xed: Well, I overheard the boss discussing some shady deals with a man in a black cloak.  
Player: Shady Deals  
Xed: Something about a sword only great warlords can use and a rare distance fighting item.  
Player: Rare Distance  
Xed: Yes, but I believe this is nothing but lies seeing that there are only a few distance fighting weapons.
