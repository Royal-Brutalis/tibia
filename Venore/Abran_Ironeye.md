Player: Hi  
Abran Ironeye: Hail, Player!  
Player: Job  
Abran Ironeye: I am a busy man. I run the Ironhouse.  
Player: Ironhouse  
Abran Ironeye: What do you think? Here weapons and armor are forged, repaired, and sold.  
Player: Excalibug  
Abran Ironeye: If someone would bring me that weapon I could reshape the realm... and reward this hero beyond his dreams.  
Player: Teddy  
Abran Ironeye: I don't know anything about a teddy... and if you are smart you shouldn't either...  
Player: Tibia  
Abran Ironeye: The world is ready for a significant change.  
Player: Banor  
Abran Ironeye: As a man that grows up needs no mommy, a warrior has to outgrow his need for gods.  
Player: King  
Abran Ironeye: I would like to see a true warrior-king in Thais... like in the old days. But who knows, perhaps one day the tides of fate will bring such a man to power. Who knows...  
Player: Thais  
Abran Ironeye: Thais has outlived its usefulness since years. Its star is sinking.  
Player: Carlin  
Abran Ironeye: Their independence is a proof for the weakness of Thais.  
Player: Excalibug  
Abran Ironeye: If someone would bring me that weapon I could reshape the realm... and reward this hero beyond his imagination.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Abran Ironeye: Quite a challenge, but his bets for power were made without the finesse of a true warrior.  
Player: Bye  
Abran Ironeye: You are dismissed.
