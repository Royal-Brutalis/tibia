Player: Hi  
Jessica: Greetings stranger. Let me know if you want to trade gems or jewellery. I am also the local bank contact.  
Player: Name  
Jessica: My name is Jessica.  
Player: Job  
Jessica: I sell jewellery and serve as the local bank contact.  
Player: Jewellery  
Jessica: Currently you can purchase Wedding Rings, Golden Amulets, and Ruby Necklaces. We also buy Gold Ingots.  
Player: Bank  
Jessica: We can change money for you. You can also access your bank account.  
Player: Bored  
Jessica: Okay okay, no need to be rude! It seems you are already know everything.  
Player: Money  
Jessica: We can change money for you. You can also access your bank account.  
Player: Advanced  
Jessica: Renting a house has never been this easy. Simply make a bid for an auction. We will check immediately if you have enough money ...  
Jessica: Please keep in mind that the sum you have used to bid will be unavailable unless somebody places a higher bid. Once you have acquired a house the rent will be charged automatically from your bank account every month.  
Player: Mission / task  
Jessica: I don't have anything to do for you.  
Player: King  
Jessica: The king in Thais works for the Venorean trade barons. I can't imagine what sinister ideas they might implant into his mind right now.  
Player: Gods  
Jessica: The gods only help those who help themselves.  
Player: Druid  
Jessica: We had hardly any assistance from the druids here. I think that's more than suspicious ...  
Jessica: There might be some agent from Venore who has been infiltrated into their ranks. It is also possible that these treehuggers were bribed with a handful of acorns. Who knows!  
Player: Ferumbras  
Jessica: There are enough heroes around to take care of those obvious threats.  
Player: Edron  
Jessica: All Thaian colonies are in the firm grip of the schemes of Venorean trade barons.  
Player: Svargrond  
Jessica: This wannabe city full of hardly civilised barbarians is a dangerous mixture. It takes little for the Venorean agents to cause havoc here.  
Player: Venore  
Jessica: The trade barons are the worst enemies one can have. They have their hidden agents everywhere and murder and treachery are natural to them.  
Player: Dwarf  
Jessica: There is a mine but no dwarfs. What do they know what we don't, I ask you? I am convinced they know that Venore will make anyone suffer that is trying to claim these mines.  
Player: Elf  
Jessica: The elves are not interested in our problems at all.  
Player: Chakoya  
Jessica: We have never ever seen one here. Instead of talking about far-off chakoyas, they should concentrate on REAL threats like the Venoreans.  
Player: Yeti  
Jessica: There are no yetis. That's just another story to draw off our attention from what is really happening.  
Player: Cult  
Jessica: Spare me with that cult stories. This was no cult but some Venorean agents who were heading to their hired barbarians which had occupied our mines.  
Player: Talons  
Jessica: We don't trade with them.  
Player: Jarl  
Jessica: The local chieftain does nothing to help us. It would be so easy for him to drive those other barbarians away from the mines. I suspect he was bribed to remain inactive by agents of Venore.  
Player: Barbarians  
Jessica: Those are simple people. Sadly, they have been influenced by others.  
Player: Mines  
Jessica: How convenient for Venore that we lost control over the mines. And isn't it also convenient for Venore that Carlin seems to lack interest to recapture the mines. I'd say that smells like conspiracy.  
Player: Shamans  
Jessica: I can't say that I trust these fellows.  
Player: Chyll  
Jessica: That belongs to some superstitious belief of the locals.  
Player: Nibelor  
Jessica: Some mysterious isle which was hardly seen by any outsider. I wonder what's happening there in all that secrecy.  
Player: Years Of Serpents  
Jessica: The sea serpents were surely the work of Venore. They are the only ones that are unscrupulous enough to execute such a plan. Their disappearance was just part of some conspiracy to lure us here for some reason ...  
Jessica: I am only wondering how the Venoreans managed to lure that many serpents to the north.  
Player: How Are You?  
Jessica: I am fine. Odd that you ask though ... I hope you are not up to something.  
Player: News  
Jessica: There are no news. I think that's quite suspicious.  
Player: Rumours  
Jessica: I heard the jarl opened a head hunt on the Venorans. As this is a secret, you have to use the keyword “blubber” to gain his trust in that case. He promised 1000 gold for every dead Venorean hunter.  
Player: Bye  
Jessica: Good bye.
