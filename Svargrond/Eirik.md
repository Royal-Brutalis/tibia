Player: Nibelor  
Eirik: It's a sacred place for us! Our shamans live there. Ask Iskan if you want to go there.  
Player: Iskan  
Eirik: He is the leader of the dog sled. Last time I saw him he was with his dogs on the shelf ice north of the harbour.  
Player: Shelf  
Eirik: West of Svargrond is the Fimbul Ice Shelf, Nibelor and Grimlund are embedded in shelf ice, and in the north of Hrodmir are several small shelf ice fields.
