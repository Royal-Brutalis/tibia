Player: Hi  
Robert: Hello, Player! Nice to see you, welcome to my weapon shop.  
Player: Name  
Robert: My name is Robert.  
Player: Job  
Robert: I am responsible for the trade with weapons and armor here in the arena. I constantly beg my superior Bertha to give me some other job or, even better, to send me back to Carlin but the cold seems to have frozen her heart.  
Player: Weapon  
Robert: I have many weapons to offer, including bows, crossbows and ammunition. If you'd like to see my offers, ask me for a trade.  
Player: Armor  
Robert: I am selling leather, chain, and brass armor. If you'd like to see my offers, ask me for a trade.  
Player: Legs  
Robert: I am selling chain legs. If you'd like to see my offers, ask me for a trade.  
Player: Mission / task  
Robert: No, I don't have anything to do for you.  
Player: King  
Robert: I heard they have a king in Thais.  
Player: Queen  
Robert: If only our beloved queen would know what dangers we have to face here. I am sure she would call us back to the safety of Carlin.  
Player: Gods  
Robert: I daily pray to the gods to protect me from harm. I still believe in a wonder to come which will get me back to Carlin.  
Player: Druids  
Robert: If there were some more druids around with all their awesome healing powers, I'd feel more comfortable.  
Player: Shamans  
Robert: They are the local witch doctors. I'd rather wait for the rare visit of a druid from Carlin than to put my life in the hands of one of those people.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Robert: Shush! Don't speak that name aloud. It might call him here.  
Player: Excalibug  
Robert: Sorry, I think we are out of stock.  
Player: News  
Robert: The good news are: I got not killed by some drunken barbarian or unskilled axe thrower. The bad news are: I am still stranded here.  
Player: Offer  
Robert: My offers are weapons, ammunition, armors, helmets, legs, and shields. If you'd like to see my offers, ask me for a {trade}.  
Player: Carlin  
Robert: Oh sweet Carlin, when will I see you again?  
Player: Edron  
Robert: Edron is in the other end of the world. I wish I were there.  
Player: Port Hope  
Robert: Port Hope and its cannibal orcs is almost as bad as Svargrond.  
Player: Thais  
Robert: Even Thais could not be worse than this frozen hell hole here.  
Player: Venore  
Robert: Jessica says they have agents everywhere. I wonder if they try to kill me to hinder our trade here ...  
Robert: Since the day I spoke with Jessica, I sleep under my bed, just to be on the safe side.  
Player: Svargrond  
Robert: Sure it looks peaceful, but to be honest, those wild barbarians are scary.  
Player: Dwarf  
Robert: You know, I thought dwarfs were rude drunkards. However, that was before I met the people here.  
Player: Elf  
Robert: Elves are strange creatures. I heard each of them can cast spells and curses. Every time an elf is looking in my direction, it gives me shivers.  
Player: Chakoya  
Robert: For all I heard, the palisades won't stop them when they come at night to kidnap sleeping people and to eat them alive.  
Player: Yeti  
Robert: Yetis are huge, but perfectly camouflaged in the snow. They attack out of nowhere and before you can scream you are dead.  
Player: Cult  
Robert: I don't know what you mean.  
Player: Jarl  
Robert: The local jarl is a fine man, measured by local standards that is. Still he can't bring me back from the dead when some of the barbarians go berserk and kill me.  
Player: Raiders  
Robert: The raiders are even wilder and, well ... more barbaric than the local barbarians. Can you imagine?!  
Player: Mines  
Robert: The mines are lost. If only the people in Carlin were to accept that and call us back.  
Player: Chyll  
Robert: That is some spirit the barbarians seem to fear.  
Player: Nibelor  
Robert: It's a haunted isle where the shamans call spirits and such to our world.  
Player: Years Of Serpents  
Robert: If those sea serpents had not vanished, I could still sit in the warm and safe Carlin. Cursed serpents.  
Player: How Are You?  
Robert: Oh, don't even ask.  
Player: Rumours  
Robert: Have you talked to Thorwulf yet?? Be careful, I heard that he killed an experienced fighter in one hit just because he was called a coward after rejecting a challenge. I myself don't even dare to look in his eyes.  
Player: Bye  
Robert: Good bye, Player.
