Player: Hi  
Sirik: LONG LIVE JARL SVEN, THE YOUNGER!  
Player: Name  
Sirik: I AM A BARBARIAN! Names are of no concern during work!! If somebody is calling for help, I will come.  
Player: Job  
Sirik: It's my duty to protect Svargrond and its citizens.  
Player: Mission  
Sirik: The shamans still have something to do for you. You should go to Nibelor and talk to them if you haven't been there for a while.  
Player: Nibelor  
Sirik: It's a sacred place for us! Our shamans live there. Ask Iskan if you want to go there.  
Player: Iskan  
Sirik: He is the leader of the dog sled. Last time I saw him he was with his dogs on the shelf ice north of the harbour.  
Player: Shelf  
Sirik: West of Svargrond is the Fimbul Ice Shelf, Nibelor and Grimlund are embedded in shelf ice, and in the north of Hrodmir are several small shelf ice fields.  
Player: Fimbul  
Sirik: Fimbul Shelf is the name of the big shelf ice west of Svargrond. A good spot to go ice fishing.  
Player: Grimlund  
Sirik: Stay away from there! It's the home of the chakoyas.  
Player: Hrodmir  
Sirik: This big, icy rock you're standing at right now. The raiders live in the middle and south of the big Formorgar glacier.  
Player: Sled  
Sirik: You can ask Iskan to bring you with his Dog Sled to Nibelor.  
Player: Magic / fruids  
Sirik: I heard Nelly talking about runes and fluids. Ask her.  
Player: Nelly  
Sirik: She is the post office clerk. Follow the moaning and you will find her.  
Player: Spells  
Sirik: That is a little too general. For what kind of profession do you need spells?  
Player: Paladin  
Sirik: You have to look for Hawkyr.  
Player: Hawkyr  
Sirik: He is the paladin trainer. You find him near the arena.  
Player: Knight  
Sirik: You have to look for Thorwulf.  
Player: Thorwulf  
Sirik: He is the trainer for knights. You find him near the arena.  
Player: Sorcerers  
Sirik: You have to look for Romir.  
Player: Romir  
Sirik: He is an old hermit who lives in a hut on the elevated plain north of Svargrond . He is some kind of male witch, you know what I mean? ...  
Sirik: He knows magic and all that. Maybe he teaches his knowledge to others.  
Player: Nor  
Sirik: Mhmmm, Nor? Nobody with that name lives here in Svargrond. Maybe he is one of the southerners that came here.  
Player: Druids  
Sirik: You have to look for Hjaern.  
Player: Hjaern  
Sirik: He is one of our shamans and trainer for druids. He lives on Nibelor.  
Player: Trainer  
Sirik: The guild masters for paladins and knights are at the arena, the shamans on Nibelor surely can teach druids new things ...  
Sirik: and Romir the old hermit who lives in a cave north of Svargrond may have some knowledge concerning magic.  
Player: City  
Sirik: Svargrond is the only city here. Do you want to know where to find a shop, a trainer for a profession or a guildhall?  
Player: Guildhall  
Sirik: In the city you will find three guildhalls. Frost Manor is on top of the cliff ...  
Sirik: Crystal Glance is north of the depot at the street which leads to the arena and Mammoth Belly is to the south, near the furrier quarter.  
Player: Arena  
Sirik: If you think you are strong enough, then try to fight there. You have to challenge waves of monsters that get stronger and stronger. ...  
Sirik: The entrance to the arena is a stairway north of the town, left of the town gate.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Sirik: Wait, wait! Don't say a word, it's, it's ...  
Sirik: that very small guy with the hairy feet? No?  
Player: Excalibug  
Sirik: I would love to have that legendary weapon. If you find it, bring it to me!  
Player: News  
Sirik: I am busy. Please ask the citizens for news.  
Player: Bye  
Sirik: MAY YOUR WEAPON ALWAYS BE SHARP!
