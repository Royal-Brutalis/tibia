Player: Hi  
Thorwulf: Hi Player.  
Player: Name  
Thorwulf: I am Thorwulf, slayer of dragons, giants and yetis.  
Player: Dragon  
Thorwulf: The dragons of these lands are fierce as a blizzard and lethal as the silent cold and the howling snow storm alike.  
Player: Yeti  
Thorwulf: The yetis are powerful and cunning foes. It takes the right bait to lure them out of their hiding places.  
Player: Bait  
Thorwulf: I won't tell. Never ever. Find out on your own.  
Player: Job  
Thorwulf: I am an expert fighter and I can teach a true warrior in the arts of war.  
Player: Mission / task  
Thorwulf: I don't have anything to do for you.  
Player: King  
Thorwulf: How can someone who never proved himself as a warrior lead people into a battle?  
Player: Queen  
Thorwulf: The people from Carlin seem to respect their queen. Though, I can't understand why. She is hardly a warrior.  
Player: Gods  
Thorwulf: I couldn't care less for gods. Every true warrior creates his own fortune.  
Player: Spells  
Thorwulf: Sorry, I don't teach spells for your vocation.  
Player: Druids  
Thorwulf: As far as I understood it, druids are like our shamans. I know enough magic to defeat my opponents on my own. So I have only little use for such spell casters  
Player: Shamans  
Thorwulf: All they are doing is talking to the spirits the whole day. My enemies, however, are of flesh and blood and I can handle them on my own.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Thorwulf: Bah, to know that he is a sorcerer means to know that he is a coward.  
Player: Excalibug  
Thorwulf: A true warrior will kill his opponents with a rusty knife. There is no need for a mighty weapon. Where is the honour if the weapon is more powerful than its wielder?  
Player: News  
Thorwulf: There are no news ... yet. But I can smell blood and steel in the air. I can feel it, there is going to be a battle soon.  
Player: Carlin  
Thorwulf: I care little for the people from Carlin. All of them are so weak and timid. I could not care less for their concerns. If they want something to be done, they will have to do it on their own.  
Player: Edron / port Hope  
Thorwulf: Some far away place the people of Carlin talk about now and then.  
Player: Svargrond  
Thorwulf: I hate it to wait here for our enemies to arrive. I'd rather go out and wage war in their camps and lairs.  
Player: Thais  
Thorwulf: Thais is not better than Carlin.  
Player: Venore  
Thorwulf: For all I know, they are schemers and liars. That means they are even worse than the other southerners.  
Player: Dwarf  
Thorwulf: I haven't seen many of them around here.  
Player: Elf  
Thorwulf: The elves that came here were quite skilled with a bow. I respect that in a way, still it takes little courage to shoot something from afar.  
Player: Chakoya  
Thorwulf: The chakoyas are small but their teeth can shred a man's arm into pieces. Their strength lies in their number as well as in ambushes on unwary or sleeping persons.  
Player: Cult  
Thorwulf: I don't care about cults.  
Player: Jarl  
Thorwulf: Our jarl has grown old. I honour him for his deeds in the past but I wonder if a younger leader wouldn't be better now. He could lead us into glorious battles with the raiders.  
Player: Raiders  
Thorwulf: Their cowardly tactics are a shame for every true barbarian, so is their obedience to a witch. They are not even worthy opponents.  
Player: Barbarian  
Thorwulf: Most people have forgotten that being a true barbarian means to be a fearless fighter.  
Player: Mines  
Thorwulf: Those Carliners seem to care about those mines, but they don't have the guts to recapture them. Pathetic.  
Player: Chyll  
Thorwulf: The wind that has seen all battles and that puts an icy blanket over the battlefields.  
Player: Nibelor  
Thorwulf: A boring piece of ice and rock on which only shamans live.  
Player: Years of Serpents  
Thorwulf: Men are not supposed to travel the seas. So I don't care if these giant serpents ever existed or if they had only been an excuse for cowards.  
Player: How are you?  
Thorwulf: As long as I am not fighting, I am bored.  
Player: Rumours  
Thorwulf: A few years ago there was an arena fighter named Alrik. He managed to win the Warlord title three times in a row. He was Svargrond's greatest hero and all of a sudden he was gone and never seen again. ...  
Thorwulf: Even his sculpture disappeared. The people say Chyll took him directly to Everspring where he could live a king's life as a reward.  
Player: Coward  
Thorwulf: You talked to Robert, did you? I think I scared him pretty well! Hehehe!  
Player: Bye  
Thorwulf: Bye Player.
