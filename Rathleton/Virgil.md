Player: hi / hello  
Virgil: Good day to you, Sir. How may I be of assistance? Bank business, perhaps?  
Player: Bank  
Virgil: We can change money for you. You can also access your bank account or your guild account options.  
Player: change  
Virgil: There are three different coin types in Tibia: 100 gold coins equal 1 platinum coin, 100 platinum coins equal 1 crystal coin. So if you’d like to change 100 gold into 1 platinum, simply say ‘change gold’ and then ‘1 platinum’.  
Player: bank account  
Virgil: Every Tibian has one. The big advantage is that you can access your money in every branch of the Tibian Bank! …  
Virgil: Would you like to know more about the basic functions of your bank account, the advanced functions, or are you already bored, perhaps?  
Player: basic  
Virgil: You can check the balance of your bank account, deposit money or withdraw it. You can also transfer money to other characters, provided that they have a vocation and are not on Dawnport.  
Player: advanced  
Virgil: Your bank account will be used automatically when you want to rent a house or bid on an item on the market. Let me know if you want to know about how either one works.  
Player: balance  
Virgil: I think you must be one of the richest inhabitants of Tibia! Your account balance is 16552758 gold.  
Player: deposit  
Virgil: You don’t have any gold with you.  
Player: withdraw  
Virgil: Please tell me how much gold you would like to withdraw.  
Player: transfer  
Virgil: Please tell me the amount of gold you would like to transfer.  
Player: rent  
Virgil: Renting a house has never been this easy. Simply make a bid for an auction on the house section of the official Tibia website. We will check immediately if you have enough money …  
Virgil: Please keep in mind that the sum you have used to bid will be unavailable unless somebody places a higher bid. Once you have acquired a house the rent will be charged automatically from your bank account every month.  
Player: market  
Virgil: If you buy an item from the market, the required gold will be deducted from your bank account automatically. On the other hand, money you earn for selling items via the market will be added to your account. It’s easy!  
Player: minotaur  
Virgil: Those creatures are a constant threat. I am glad that our city guards take care of protecting the city against their continual raids! However, if you could spare some time, I am sure some assistance would not come amiss.  
Player: airtight cloth  
Virgil: What a modern idea. I see no practical use at present.  
Player: alaistar  
Virgil: Dr Stanton is one of our most renown researchers in the fields of magical liquids and Oramondian botany. …  
Virgil: He has written extensive works on the minotaurs especially, and thinks it possible to communicate with them. <sniffs> Imagine that! Communicate with our enemies! It needs a scientific mind like Dr Stanton’s to have such a … peacable notion.  
Player: barazbaz  
Virgil: Our local historian is well versed in our city’s past. Feel free to visit him – or to read through our library in the magistrate.  
Player: barnabas dee  
Virgil: Mr Dee has a somewhat unusual hobby – he is an astrologer. Or was it astronomer? Please excuse me, I am not an adept in these things. Ah yes, and he also teaches sorcerer spells.  
Player: bored  
Virgil: Okay okay, no need to be rude! It seems you already know everything.  
Player: buy  
Virgil: We can change money for you. You can also access your bank account or your guild account options.  
Player: thais  
Virgil: We may be interested in trading further goods and glooth products, but that will be voted on by the magistrate.  
Player: christine  
Virgil: Young Miss D’Albay indulges in running a little business these days, but I am certain you will find her glooth sandwiches to your taste.  
Player: glooth  
Virgil: The wealth of our city. Did you know that it is of animal origin? There is a book about it somewhere, I am sure.  
Player: king  
Virgil: Ruled by a king? We had a princess, once. Ah, that was long ago. Primitive times.  
Player: dr merlay / emily / henry  
Virgil: I am sorry, I do not discuss other clients’ matters with a third, as a rule.  
Player: edmund  
Virgil: Ah, yes. Mr Orlond has rented the upper storey. You will find there a selection of the finest Oramondian jewellery.  
Player: factory  
Virgil: The new factory will surely prove beneficial to Rathleton’s financial success.  
Player: fayla  
Player: food  
Player: fyodor  
Virgil: Ah. <coldly> Our local post officer and news editor. I believe you will find him quite outspoken on political matters of Oramond, if a little inclined to drama.  
Player: gossip  
Virgil: I am unable to relate the exact sayings of the lower caste to you, but I believe that most gossips emerge from the older part of town. Ask someone in any tavern there, and you will hear all the sailor’s yarn you can possibly wish for.  
Player: graham  
Virgil: Our local knight trainer. <sniffs> He does a fairly good job, or so I am told. Please excuse me, I have pressing matters to attend to.  
Player: job  
Virgil: I am the director of the Oramond Island Bank.  
Player: magistrate  
Virgil: Yes, the magistrate executes the will of the people. It is a most remarkable institution. If you wish to learn more about our city, you should visit Barazbaz, the magistrate’s historian.  
Player: maro  
Virgil: That minotaur Dr Stanton brought with him from a field trip is a constant source of danger, a threat to our city! Sadly, Dr Stanton perseveres in a most unfortunate naivete regarding his ‘foster-son’.  
Player: minotaur / minotaurs  
Virgil: Those creatures are a constant threat. I am glad that our city guards take care of protecting the city against their continual raids! However, if you could spare some time, I am sure some assistance would not come amiss.  
Player: maxxen  
Virgil: He turned evil and built a golem army to destroy the city. But he was stopped.  
Player: mordecai  
Virgil: Professor Stanton is an expert on runes and wands. He used to teach sorcerer spells as well, but has now left that post to his close friend, Mr Barnabas Dee.  
Player: name  
Virgil: Virgil Carefew, at your service.  
Player: virgil  
Virgil: The name runs in our family since generations, and is traditionally given to the firstborn son.  
Player: news  
Virgil: I read in the Oramond Observer that gloothomir papers are still in high demand,whereas the gloothine seems to be suffering a sudden loss of favour.  
Player: guild  
Virgil: You can transfer money from your account to the account of a guild via player guild transfer. If you are a member of a guild, you can deposit money on its account via guild deposit. …  
Virgil: If you are leader or vice leader of a guild, you can also withdraw gold from your guild account via guild withdraw or use a guild transfer to transfer money from your guild to another guild. …  
Virgil: As a leader or vice leader of a guild you can also transfer money from your guild account to a player account via guild player transfer. …  
Virgil: Please keep in mind that we may need some time to process such requests.  
Player: silas  
Virgil: A very ancient family of impeccable repute. Silas, the youngest son, is a proficiant bowmaker and learned paladin trainer. You should visit his shop if you need ammunition.  
Player: slums  
Virgil: The lower part of the city is, sadly, quite derelict. It used to be the heart of the older Rathleton town, but times have changed, and with the discovery of glooth, some have prospered and some have not. …  
Virgil: Nowadays, only the poor and destitute live there. However, rents in the lower part of town are low, which is why scientists and tradesmen continue to run their business near the harbour.  
Player: time  
Virgil: It is 5:58 am, precisely.  
Player: terrence  
Virgil: An energetic man, and also the captain of the city guards. If you wish to undertake a mission for the city, he is the man to talk to.  
Player: bye / farewell  
Virgil: Enjoy your day, Sir.
