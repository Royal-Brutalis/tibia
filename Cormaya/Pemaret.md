Pemaret: Passages to Edron and Eremo's Island. Also selling fresh fish!  
Player: hi  
Pemaret: Greetings, young man. Looking for a passage or some fish, Player?  
Player: fish  
Pemaret: My fish is of the finest quality you could find. Ask me for a trade to check for yourself.  
Player: job  
Pemaret: I'm a fisherman and I take along people to Edron. You can also buy some fresh fish.  
Player: name  
Pemaret: My name is Pemaret, the fisherman.  
Player: boat / ship  
Pemaret: My boat is ready to bring you to Edron.  
Player: sea  
Pemaret: I love to sail on the seas of Tibia.  
Player: shimmer / swimmer  
Pemaret: Now that's a special one. Where did you hear about it? I would be interested, you know... Well, this fish is extremely rare and cannot be found in normal, clean freshwater. ...  
Pemaret: If you want to catch one, you will have to look for a really dirty lake. If you were able to catch one however, this would be a very versatile haul. ...  
Pemaret: It is said that, in combination with certain magical or non-magical items, this fish somehow... changes his looks and gains a completely new purpose. I heard of someone making a weapon out of it! ...  
Pemaret: Hey, don't look at me like that. It... it's just a tale what do I know. ...  
Pemaret: Anyway, I heard of people using flintstones, the hair and wax of strange creatures I never saw before, an eye of a foreign sea beast and some kind of old, broken ring.  
Player: cormaya / isle  
Pemaret: It's a lovely and peaceful isle. Did you already visit the nice sandy beach?  
Player: edron  
Pemaret: Do you want to get to Edron for 10 gold?  
Player: eremo / sage  
Pemaret: Oh, you know the good old sage Eremo. I can bring you to his little island. Do you want me to do that?  
Player: tibia  
Pemaret: I love to sail on the seas of Tibia.  
Player: bye  
Pemaret: Good bye, Player. You are welcome.
