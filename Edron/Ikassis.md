Player: hi  
Ikassis: Nature's blessing, traveler!  
Player: name  
Ikassis: My name is Ikassis. It means ,the long-sighted'.  
Player: job  
Ikassis: Job? I have no idea what this peculiar word could mean.  
Player: time  
Ikassis: Time is a human concept, traveler.  
Player: Ab'Dendriel  
Ikassis: It's a place full of life, huge trees, lush plants and various animals. I visited it once when Alkestios took me there. It is a place of beauty.  
Player: Thais/Carlin/Venore/Darashia/Edron  
Ikassis: It's a place full of stone buildings and mortal beings. I guess you call it a town. But I'm still not sure which purpose it serves.  
Player: Kazordoon  
Ikassis: It is located somewhere in the mountains, I guess.  
Player: Darama  
Ikassis: I guess it's a desert.  
Player: Roshamuul  
Ikassis: This is a dark and dangerous place. It is full of terrible monsters and made of nightmares - literally.  
Player: Oramond/Rathleton/Krailos  
Ikassis: I have never heard of this place.  
Player: Feyrist  
Ikassis: It is a secret, hidden place. Just few mortals get permission to enter it. A long time ago, we learned how to hide our realm from the outside world. Only if you gain our trust I will tell you how to reach it.  
Player: realm  
Ikassis: We call it Feyrist and it is a secret, hidden place. Just few mortals get permission to enter it. A long time ago, we learned how to hide our realm from the outside world. Only if you gain our trust I will tell you how to reach it.  
Player: protect  
Ikassis: A strange dark energy is seeping into our world lately. It is pervading all continents and islands and it grows stronger with every day. Yet I don't know where it arises from nor what we could do to dispel it.  
Player: energy  
Ikassis: It is still somewhat in hiding, so most creatures won't sense it ... yet. But its corrosive power has already begun to affect my kind and our hidden realm in unpleasant ways.  
Player: kind/siblings  
Ikassis: We call ourselves the fae. Some name us nature spirits or peri but we prefer the former term. Most of us are rather reclusive and live peaceful lives in our secret realm. We only leave it in order to protect our home. ...  
Ikassis: As we tend to be secretive about our true nature I'm afraid I can't tell you more.  
Player: Fae  
Ikassis: Some call us nature spirits or peri but we prefer the term fae. Most of us are rather reclusive and live peaceful lives in our secret realm. We only leave it in order to protect our home. ...  
Ikassis: As we tend to be secretive about our true nature I'm afraid I can't tell you more.  
Player: dreams  
Ikassis: There is far more to dreams than mortal beings are aware of. They possess some kind of magical power, ancient and mysterious. I shouldn't tell you too much about it, but I can tell you that the fae are closely linked to this power.  
Player: dwarves  
Ikassis: We know them, yes. Their dreams are different from those of elves and humans. Somehow graver and more grounded.  
Player: elves  
Ikassis: They inhabit Ab'Dendriel and live in close touch with nature. Their dreams are mostly serene and suffused with light.  
Player: humans  
Ikassis: They inhabit these huge places filled with stone buildings. They call them towns, I guess. Some of them are cheerful and well-meaning, others are wicked and cruel. Their traits and attitudes vary greatly - and so do their dreams.  
Player: snake  
Ikassis: Outside of our secret realm my siblings and I can't keep our true shape. If we want to travel other parts of the world, we must take over the bodies of animals. But we are causing them no harm and we just take control if necessary.  
Player: Alkestios  
Ikassis: He's a brother of mine. He took it upon himself to kind of lead our mission in the outside world. You may find him south of Ab'Dendriel.  
Player: bye  
Ikassis: May Mother Nature protect you.
