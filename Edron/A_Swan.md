A Swan: It's a secret, hidden place. Only very few mortals get permission to enter it. A long time ago, we learned how to hide our realm from the outside world. Only if you gain our trust you will get permission to enter it.  
Player: Dream  
A Swan: There is far more to dreams than mortal beings are aware of. They possess some kind of magical power, ancient and mysterious. I shouldn't tell you too much about it, but I can tell you that the fae are closely linked to this power.  
Player: fae  
A Swan: Some call us nature spirits or peri but we prefer the term fae. Most of us are rather reclusive and live peaceful lives in our secret realm. We only leave it in order to protect our home. ...  
A Swan: As we tend to be secretive about our true nature I'm afraid I can't tell you more.  
Player: realm  
A Swan: We call it Feyrist and it is a secret, hidden place. Only very few mortals get permission to enter it. A long time ago, we learnt how to hide our realm from the outside world. Only if you gain our trust you will get permission to enter it.  
Player: protect  
A Swan: Dark energies are seeping into the world. They are tainting our home as much as everything else. We couldn't discover the origin of these energies on Feyrist itself, Therefore, some of us decided to leave our home and investigate.
