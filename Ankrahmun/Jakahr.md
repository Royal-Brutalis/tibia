Player: hi  
Jakahr: Hello, mourned pilgrim. How may I help you player?  
Player: offer or buy  
Jakahr: I sell parcels and letters. Ask me for a trade if you're interested. I can also explain how the mail system works.  
Player: trade  
Jakahr: Here. Don't forget that you need to buy a label too if you want to send a parcel. Always write the name of the receiver in the first line and the name of the city in the second line.  
Player: mail or mailbox  
Jakahr: With our mail system you can send letters and parcels to other Tibians. I can either explain how letters and parcels work or sell them to you if you ask me for a trade.  
Player: letters  
Jakahr: If you want to buy a letter, ask me for a trade. Or do you want me to explain how letters work?  
Player: explain or help  
Jakahr: With a letter you can send a message to another Tibian's depot. If you want to send it to 'Ben' in 'Thais', use the letter - so that a form opens - and write 'Ben' in the first line and 'Thais' in the second line. Write your message below that. ...  
Jakahr: Then drag your letter on one of the blue mailboxes here to send it.  
Player: depot  
Jakahr: Each major city has at least one depot. Just step in front of one of the lockers and you can store items inside. Your mail will also arrive there. Each city has its own storage, don't forget where you store items!  
Player: parcel  
Jakahr: If you want to buy a parcel, ask me for a trade. Or do you want me to explain how parcels work?  
Player: explain  
Jakahr: In a parcel you can send items to another Tibian's depot. Put your items into the parcel and also place a completed label with the name and the city of the receiver inside. Then drag your parcel on one of the blue mailboxes here to send it.

Jakahr: The depots you can send parcels or letters to are in the following cities: Ab'Dendriel, Ankrahmun, Carlin, Darashia, Edron, Farmine, Kazordoon, Liberty Bay, Port Hope, Svargrond, Thais, Venore and Yalahar.  
Player: label  
Jakahr: If you want to buy a label, ask me for a trade. Or do you want me to explain how labels work?  
Player: explain  
Jakahr: Including a label in your parcel is important. Imagine you want to send it to 'Ben' in 'Thais'. Use the label - so that a form opens - and write 'Ben' in the first line and 'Thais' in the second line. Check the spelling and put it in your parcel! ...  
Jakahr: Then drag your parcel on one of the blue mailboxes here to send it.  
Player: receiver

Jakahr: The pharaoh keeps this city safe. He is both our political and our spiritual leader.  
Player: akh or rah or uthun  
Jakahr: Sorry, but you should discuss religous issues like these in the temple. I am not a priest, and there is little I can tell you about it.  
Player: excalibug  
Jakahr: A weapon of legend. We rarely hear stories about it around here, however.  
Player: bye  
Jakahr: It was an honour to serve you, player.
