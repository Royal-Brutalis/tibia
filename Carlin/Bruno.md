Player: Hi  
Bruno: Ahoi, Player. You want to buy some fresh fish?  
Player: Job  
Bruno: My job is to catch fish and to sell them here.  
Player: Marlene  
Bruno: Ah yes, my lovely wife. God forgive her, but she can't stop talking. So my work is a great rest for my poor ears. *laughs loudly*  
Player: Graubart  
Bruno: I like this old salt. I learned much from him. Whatever. You like some fish? *grin*  
Player: Bye  
Bruno: Good bye and come again!
