Player: Hi  
Hjaern: Be greeted, Player. The spiritual world looks upon you and your deeds.  
Player: Name  
Hjaern: The spirits call me by the name of Hjaern and that is how I shall be known.  
Player: Job  
Hjaern: I would not consider this as a job. But one of my responsibilities is the training of young shamans. Even druids can learn a few new tricks from me.  
Player: Shamans  
Hjaern: We try to figure out the will of the spirits and ways to appease them.  
Player: News  
Hjaern: The news I receive are from the spiritual world. They would be of little importance for you.  
Player: Cult  
Hjaern: We had no contact with the people that passed Svargrond. Their arrival has caused some disturbance in  the spirits' world though. ...  
Hjaern: Ancient spirits are restless. It seems that some things that should have been left alone, have awoken from their slumber. I can't tell more yet.  
Player: Gods  
Hjaern: Your foreign gods are concepts we don't really understand.  
Player: King  
Hjaern: There should be no such thing like a human that is ruling over the lives of other humans.  
Player: Chakoya  
Hjaern: The chakoyas are like a force of nature. It would be wrong to try to exterminate them. On the other hand, we can't allow their carnivorous nature to threaten our lives.  
Player: Yeti  
Hjaern: The yetis are real. They are elusive but dangerous. Some say they are rather residents of the spirits' world than ours. The spirits are silent about them which is an even greater enigma.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Hjaern: He is of no importance here.  
Player: Svargrond  
Hjaern: The city was a necessity. Just like the spirit needs a haven of safety and retreat, so does the body need it.  
Player: Excalibug  
Hjaern: That's something I only heard about in curious questions of people like you.  
Player: Rumours  
Hjaern: Months ago, many strange looking people passed Svargrond. The inhabitants tell stories about a cult they belong to. ...  
Hjaern: It is rumoured that they are trying to awake unholy spirits in the mountains. Maybe other people know more about that cult.  
Player: Chyll  
Hjaern: Father north wind is the supreme ruler of the North. His ways are almost unpredictable to us humans since his thoughts span ages. ...  
Hjaern: We can only do our best to interpret his will correctly and act accordingly. One has to move with the wind after all, else it will destroy you. This is the way things are here in the North and the way of our people.  
Player: Bye  
Hjaern: Good bye, Player.
