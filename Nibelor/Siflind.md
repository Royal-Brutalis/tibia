Player: hi  
Siflind: Be greeted, Player. If you are in need of potions or magical equipment, just ask me about my offers.  
Player: Name  
Siflind: I am Siflind, my child.  
Player: Job  
Siflind: I am a shaman. That should tell you everything you want to know, my child. But I also sell some potions, wands and runes.  
Player: Offers  
Siflind: I'm selling spirit, health and mana potions, runes, wands, rods and spellbooks. If you'd like to see all of my offers, ask me for a trade.  
Player: Trade  
Siflind: Of course, just browse through my wares. Or do you want to look only at potions, wands or runes?  
Player: News  
Siflind: News are usually bad news in these times. So be happy if there aren't any news.  
Player: Rumours  
Siflind: I don't think much of rumours but in fact there is a story that always comes to my mind. It is more a tale than a rumour,  but anyway ...... it says the chakoyas have not always been that hostile. ...  
Siflind: There must have been an incident that shook their trust in manhood so strongly that it would last forever. Imagine that we could be friends if only that incident never happened ......... whatever that was.  
Player: Chakoyas  
Siflind: The chakoyas can be a terrible menace if they aren't kept away.  
Player: Yeti  
Siflind: Even an old woman like me has not seen a yeti yet. However, this does not mean that they don't exist.  
Player: Cult  
Siflind: I heard a secretive group of people passed Svargrond a while ago. Later others followed. We don't know why they came here and where they went.  
Player: Svargrond  
Siflind: The city seems to have brought the needed stability and peace to my people.  
Player: Barbarian  
Siflind: We barbarians are proud people.  
Player: Bye  
Siflind: Good bye and take care, Player.
