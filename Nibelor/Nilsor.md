Player: Hi  
Nilsor: Greetings, traveller Player. Is there anything I can do for you'?  
Player: Name  
Nilsor: I am Nilor.  
Player: Job  
Nilsor: I see after the dogs. I try to be a good friend and pack leader for them. Oh and I can offer you a passage to Svargrond.  
Player: Svargrond  
Nilsor: I don't like big cities. They make me and my dogs nervus.  
Player: Nibelor  
Nilsor: Here we have some peace from the daily life of our fellow humans that would only distractus.  
Player: Chyll  
Nilsor: The wisdom of the north wind is beyond our comprehension. We are all but snowflakes in the wnd.  
Player: Gods  
Nilsor: To worship some distant gods seems more useless to me than the howling of a wolf to the mon.  
Player: Shaman  
Nilsor: We are the contact to the spirit world as well as the protector of the natural balace.  
Player: Chakoy  
Nilsor: The chakoyas have a strong brute side. It would be wrong to condemn them for tat.  
Player: Yeti  
Nilsor: Humans would be well advised to leave the elusive yeti alne.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Nilsor: A perfect example of what is wrong with humanty.  
Player: Excalibug  
Nilsor: I have no iea.  
Player: King  
Nilsor: Only humans could come up with a concept where heritage replaces competece.  
Player: News  
Nilsor: I don't care much about the gossip that people are constantly spreadng.  
Player: Rumours  
Nilsor: Okay, I tell you what.......A fisherman from Svargrond was near Okolnir when he saw it. A frozen dragon! But all of a sudden it was gone. The question is did that poor dead creature disappear or was that fisherman telling les?  
Player: Bye  
Nilsor: Good bye, Player.
