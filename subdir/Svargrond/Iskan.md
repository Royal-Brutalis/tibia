Player: Hi  
Iskan: HAIL to the Warlord of the arena! Player, Hero of Svargrond! What can I do for you?  
Player: Name  
Iskan: I am Iskan.  
Player: Job  
Iskan: I run the dog sled service from this city to Nibelor.  
Player: Nibelor  
Iskan: I can bring you to Nibelor with the sled if you want to. Just ask for a passage.  
Player: Passage  
Iskan: So, do you want a passage to Nibelor my friend?  
Player: Gods  
Iskan: In my whole long life, I've not seen any sign of those gods the people of the south are constantly talking about.  
Player: King / Queen  
Iskan: We don't need any kings or queens. Am I right, boys? Yeah, I am.  
Player: Chakoya  
Iskan: Nasty little beasts. Me and the boys had quite some bloody encounters with them on the ice.  
Player: Yeti  
Iskan: The yeti is real and dangerous.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Iskan: Easy, boys! Don't mention that name again. Makes the boys nuts, ye know?  
Player: Svargrond  
Iskan: This city seems to be growing every day. First, there have been only a few huts and now ... look around, houses everywhere.  
Player: Excalibug  
Iskan: Yeah, where could it be. That's the question.  
Player: Chyll  
Iskan: The icy father. We know him all too well, am I right boys? He has claimed so many old friends in all those years. So many.  
Player: Rumours  
Iskan: I heard something about a ship crashing in the shelf ice between Nibelor and Grimlund. If I were you, I wouldn't go to chakoya terrain. It's pretty dangerous.  
Player: Bye  
Iskan: Farewell, Warlord of the arena, Player, Hero of Svargrond!
