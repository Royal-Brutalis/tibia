Player: hi  
Aruda: Oh, hello, handsome! It's a pleasure to meet you, Player. Gladly I have the time to chat a bit.  
Player: name  
Aruda: I'm a little sad that you seem to have forgotten me, handsome. I'm Aruda.  
Player: help  
Aruda: I'm deeply sorry, I can't help you.  
Player: how are you  
Aruda: Thank you very much. How kind of you to care about me. I'm fine, thank you.  
Player: chat or job  
Aruda: I do some work now and then. Nothing unusual, though. So I have plenty time to chat. If you are interested in any topic just ask me.  
Player: news  
Aruda: You should ask Oswald about news. He loves them.  
Player: rumors or rumours  
Aruda: I'm a little shy and so I don't hear many rumours  
Player: gods  
Aruda: You should ask about that in one of the temples.  
Player: Yenny  
Aruda: Yenny? I know no Yenny, nor have I ever used that name! You must have mistaken me with someone else. (leaves the discussion)  
Player: thief  
Aruda: Oh sorry, I have to hurry, bye! (leaves the discussion)  
Player: dogs  
Aruda: I like dogs, the little ones at least. Do you like dogs, too?  
Player: king  
Aruda: The king that lives in this fascinating castle? I think he does look kind of cute in his luxurious robes, doesn't he?  
Player: castle  
Aruda: I love this castle! It's so beautiful.  
Player: kiss  
Aruda: Oh, you little devil, stop talking about that! <blush>  
Player: Aruda  
Aruda: Oh, I like the way you say my name.  
Player: Benjamin  
Aruda: He is a little simple minded but always nice and well dressed.  
Player: Bozo  
Aruda: Oh, isn't he funny? I could listen to him the whole day.  
Player: Eclesius  
Aruda: He often passes me on the way to Frodo's.  
Player: Elane  
Aruda: I personally think it's inappropriate for a woman to become a warrior, what do you think about that?  
Player: Frodo  
Aruda: Oh, a girl like me shouldn't go to this place.  
Player: Gorn  
Aruda: He should really sell some stylish gowns or something like that. We Tibians never get some clothing of the latest fashion. It's a shame.  
Player: Gregor  
Aruda: I like brave fighters like him.  
Player: Marvik  
Aruda: Druids seldom visit a town. What do you know about druids?  
Player: Muriel  
Aruda: Powerful sorcerers frighten me a little.  
Player: Noodles  
Aruda: Oh, he is sooooo cute!  
Player: Oswald  
Aruda: As far as I know, he's working in the castle.  
Player: Partos  
Aruda: I ... don't know someone named like that.  
Player: Quentin  
Aruda: I don't understand this lonely monks. I love company too much to become one. Hehehe!  
Player: Sam  
Aruda: He is soooo strong! What muscles! What a body! On the other hand, compared to you he looks quite puny.  
Player: Tibia  
Aruda: I'd like to visit the beach more often, but I guess it's too dangerous.  
Player: monsters  
Aruda: UH! What a terrifying topic. Please let us speak about something more pleasant, I'm a weak and small woman after all.
