Player: Hi  
Lugri: What is it that you want, Player?  
Player: Job  
Lugri: I am a priest of Zathroth, the bringer of dark secrets.  
Player: King  
Lugri: This puny king is no threat for our master's plans.  
Player: Life  
Lugri: Life is war. It's about survival of the fittest.  
Player: Mission / Quest  
Lugri: Aren't we all on a quest for survival and supremacy?  
Player: Fight  
Lugri: Life is an eternal fight!  
Player: Help  
Lugri: If you cant help yourself you are not worth of my assistance.  
Player: People  
Lugri: The people of Tibia are sheep, so be smart and strong enough to become their wolf.  
Player: Name  
Lugri: My name is Lugri.  
Player: Tibia  
Lugri: The world of Tibia is to be taken by the strongest.  
Player: Time  
Lugri: Who cares?  
Player: Monsters  
Lugri: They are a challenge to sift the chaff from the wheat.  
Player: Goshnar  
Lugri: The necromant king was only defeated by the nightmare knights due to a bad twist of fate.  
Player: Pits Of Inferno  
Lugri: After the ruthless seven conquered it, it's again a holy place for the followers of the dark path.  
Player: Excalibug  
Lugri: It's existence is just a lie to inspire hope and bravery in the hearts of the followers of good.  
Player: Necromants Nectar  
Lugri: That's none of your business!  
Player: God  
Lugri: The gods of darkness give us the chance to reach our whole potentials, the gods of good want to capture us in eternal stasis!  
Player: Gods Of Darkness  
Lugri: The glorious gods of darkness are Zathroth, Fafnar, Brog, Urgith, and the Archdemons.  
Player: Zathroth  
Lugri: Zathroth represents the true and unbound power of magic. He is the keeper of great secrets.  
Player: Fafnar  
Lugri: Fafnar is the power of the sun. She burns the weak to ashes.  
Player: Brog  
Lugri: Brog, the raging one, the great destroyer, the berserk of darkness ... call him how you like, but fear his awesome power.  
Player: Urgith  
Lugri: Urgith is the master of the undead. The bonemaster also takes care of the damned souls.  
Player: Archdemons  
Lugri: The demons are powerful followers of Zathroth. Their leaders are known as the ruthless seven.  
Player: Ruthless Seven  
Lugri: Infernatil, Pumin, Verminor, Tafariel, Apocalypse, Bazir and Ashfalor.  
Player: Infernatil  
Lugri: The incendiary of hell.  
Player: Pumin  
Lugri: He is the lord of despair.  
Player: Verminor  
Lugri: Ah, the plaguelord.  
Player: Tafariel  
Lugri: She is the mistress of the damned! Rewarding or torturing, it is the same for her victims!  
Player: Apocalypse  
Lugri: It is said even speaking its TRUE name will bring total destruction to you!  
Player: Bazir  
Lugri: He is the great deciver, the lord of lies.  
Player: Ashfalor  
Lugri: The right hand of Urgith. The general of the undead hordes.  
Player: Good Or Light  
Lugri: The so-called Gods of Good are Fardos, Uman, the Elements, Suon, Crunor, Nornur, Bastesh, Kirok, Toth, and Banor.  
Player: Fardos  
Lugri: Fardos is the creator. He is a helpless watcher whose 'creation' is far more then he bargained for.  
Player: Uman  
Lugri: Uman is a jealous keeper of magic. He shares only fragments of his knowledge with the mortals. To be strong one must take, not wait to be given, with Gods like that!.  
Player: Elements  
Lugri: The Elements are Tibia, Sula, Air and Fire.  
Player: Suon  
Lugri: Suon is one of the suns of our world. He gives his light mindlessly to the weak and the strong alike.  
Player: Crunor  
Lugri: Crunor is the God of nature, of plants and trees ... and plants and trees are there to be stomped upon and burnt!  
Player: Nornur  
Lugri: Nornur claims to be a God of Fate without even understanding the ways of fate at all.  
Player: Bastesh  
Lugri: Bastesh is so afraid that she hides in the depth of the seas.  
Player: Kirok  
Lugri: Kirok, the mad one, is the patron of scientists and jesters, more a nuisance than a god.  
Player: Toth  
Lugri: Toth is just the undertaker for the other 'gods of good'.  
Player: Banor  
Lugri: Banor isn't a God at all, merely one of their tools. Is it not stupidity to worship a tool?  
Player: Tibia  
Lugri: The world of Tibia is there to be taken by the strongest. When the time is right, it will fall like an overripe plum...  
Player: Sula  
Lugri: Sula is just the mindless elemental power of water.  
Player: Air  
Lugri: Air is just a mindless elemental force.  
Player: Fire  
Lugri: Fire is just a mindless elemental force.  
Player: Task  
Lugri: What? Who are you to imply I need help from a worm like you? ...  
Player: Yes  
Lugri: You do? I mean - wise decision. Let me explain. By now, Tibia has been overrun by numerous followers of different cults and beliefs. The true Necromancers died or left Tibia long ago, shortly after their battle was lost. ...  
Lugri: What is left are mainly pseudo-dark pretenders, the old wisdom and power being far beyond their grasp. They think they have the right to tap that dark power, but they don't. ...  
Lugri: I want you to eliminate them. As many as you can. Both necromancers and priestesses. And as I said, don't expect a reward - this is what has to be done to cleanse Tibia of its false dark prophets.  
Player: Donation  
Lugri: Do you want to make a donation?  
Player: Yes  
Lugri: May the gods of darkness bless you!  
Player: Bye  
Lugri: Leave now, Player. The gods of darkness will watch your soul!
