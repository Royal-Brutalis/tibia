Player: Hi  
Aneus: Greetings adventurer Player. What leads you to me?  
Player: Story  
Aneus: Ok, sit down and listen. Back in the early days, one of the ancestors ... <press m for more>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... of our king Tibianus III wanted to build the best city in whole of Tibia.  
Player: City  
Aneus: The works on this new city began and the king sent his best ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... Soldiers to protect the workers from orcs and to make them WORK HARDER.  
Player: Soldiers  
Aneus: It was the elite of the whole army. They were called the Red Legion (also known as the bloody legion).  
Player: Orcs  
Aneus: The orcs attacked the workers from time to time and so they disturbed the works on the city.  
Player: Works  
Aneus: The development of the city was fine. Also a giant castle was build ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... northeast of the city. But more and more workers started to rebel because of the bad conditions.  
Player: Rebel  
Aneus: All rebels were brought to the giant castle. Guarded by the Red Legion, ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... they had to work and live in even worser conditions. Also some friends of the king's sister were brought there.  
Player: Friends  
Aneus: The king's sister was pretty upset about the situation there but her brother ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... didn't want to do anything about this matter. So she made a PLAN to destroy the Red Legion for their cruelty forever.  
Player: Cruelty  
Aneus: The soldiers treated the workers like slaves.  
Player: Plan  
Aneus: She ordered her loyal druids and hunters to disguise themselves ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... as orcs from the near ISLAND and to ATTACK the Red Legion by night over and over again.  
Player: Island  
Aneus: The General of the Red Legion became very angry about these attacks and after some months he STROKE back!  
Player: Stroke  
Aneus: Most of the Red Legion went to the island by night. The orcs ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... were not prepared and the Red Legion killed hundreds of orcs ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... with nearly no loss. After they were satisfied they WALKED BACK to the castle.  
Player: Walked back  
Aneus: It is said that the orcish shamans cursed the Red Legion. <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: Nobody knows. But one third of the soldiers died by a disease on the way back. <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: And the orcs wanted to take revenge, and after some days they stroke back! <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: The orcs and many allied cyclopses and minotaurs from all ...<m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... over Tibia came to avenge their friends, and they killed nearly all ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... workers and soldiers in the castle. The HELP of the king's sister came too late.  
Player: Help  
Aneus: She tried to rescue the workers but it was too late. The orcs ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... started immediately to attack her troops, too. Her royal troops ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... went back to the city. A trick saved the city from destruction.  
Player: Destruction  
Aneus: They used the same trick as against the Red Legion and the orcs ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... started to fight their non-orcish-allies. After a bloody long fight ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... the orcs went back to their cities. The city of Carlin was rescued. <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: Since then, a woman has always been ruling over Carlin and this statue ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... was made to remind us of their great tactics against the orcs ... <m>  
Player: m  
Aneus: ... and the Red Legion. So that was the story of Carlin and these Fields of Glory. I hope you liked it. *He smiles*  
Player: Bye  
Aneus: Good bye and take care of you!
