Player: hi / hello  
Nathaniel: Greetings Player! You look like a friend of nature! Oh by the way, I have some news about the contest unless you want to talk about bonus points first!  
Player: envelope  
Nathaniel: The three wizards dropped these envelopes everywhere in the world. A lot of creatures have been carrying envelopes all over Tibia.  
Player: bonus  
Nathaniel: You currently have no bonus points to spend. Would you like me to explain the bonus point system or do you want to exchange coloured powders?  
Player: exchange / queen / select / luck / chess  
Nathaniel: Mh, you are not of green colour. Either you did not join a wizard yet or – the unthinkable – you joined a different colour than green! You can only claim a reward from me once you have joined the green wizard.  
Player: explain  
Nathaniel: Alright. Shall I talk about the collecting points or your rewards for exchanging points? Or do you ask yourself why Zaoan chess?  
Player: fan  
Nathaniel: There are two others like me, an orange fan in Carlin and some girl for violet in Thais. Trust me green is the colour to go… but hey, you can always check out the others.  
Player: fern  
Nathaniel: Fern is the wizard of Nature. Behold his powers and the elemental might that is nature itself.  
Player: furb / fun / orange / violer / spend

Player: green / colour  
Nathaniel: Green is my colour. It is what I stand for. Green represents the wizard Fern of Nature of which I am a great fan.  
Player: job  
Nathaniel: I am a fan and want to inform other Tibians about the BEST colour to join, the best wizard, the great CAUSE! NATURE! Wizard Fern, whose colour is green of course!  
Player: join  
Nathaniel: You can join any wizard by using the powder you can find in the envelope on yourself and the rest on someone who did not already join a wizard and has the right colour. …

Player: points  
Nathaniel: As you know, the three wizards scattered magical envelopes all over Tibia. During this event, a lot of different kinds of monsters will drop those magic envelopes. …

Nathaniel: The fans of Feiz, the violet wizard of power will accept red and blue powders, Furb of Fun’s orange fans will accept yellow and red.  
Player: powder  
Nathaniel: The envelopes that came with the creatures contain a magical powder. The three wizards created it to let you represent each of their elements.

Nathaniel: For 20 points you will be able to select a figurine of a random colour except the queen. …  
Nathaniel: For 60 points you will receive a queen. Guaranteed and on top of that you will be able to choose the colour as well. …  
Nathaniel: You will receive the chess box for free from the appropriate fan if you have joined a wizard. Just ask me how to spend your points if you are ready.  
Player: status  
Nathaniel: Violet seems to be the winning colour at the moment. Green is the runner-up.  
Player: tibianus  
Nathaniel: I wonder what colour he chose…  
Player: wizard / contest  
Nathaniel: There are 3 wizards. Each of them represents a different element which can be easily identified by a unique colour. …  
Nathaniel: There is ‘orange’ for wizard Furb of Fun, ‘green’ for wizard Fern of Nature and ‘violet’ for wizard Feiz of Power.  
Player: Zaoan  
Nathaniel: Well, it’s a long story. It has a lot to do with wizardry, a little with chess and quite much with a lady. I know that there must be a book about it, somewhere in a library in Thais.  
Player: bye  
Nathaniel: Farewell friend.
