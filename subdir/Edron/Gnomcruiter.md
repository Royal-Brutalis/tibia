Player: hi  
Gnomcruiter: Oh, hello. You might be one of the talented adventurers we are looking for!  
Player: talented  
Gnomcruiter: Are you interested in joining the efforts of the gnomish expedition corps?  
Player: yes  
Gnomcruiter: So listen, our prospectors recently discovered a marvelous new place deep under the surface of the world ...  
Gnomcruiter: It is a whole landmass illuminated by a strange mist that hungs over it. ...  
Gnomcruiter: It's populated by all kinds of primordeal creatures. ...  
Gnomcruiter: Some are probably the progenitors of creatures that we currently know, whereas other creatures have never been seen before. ...  
Gnomcruiter: In a joint venture with the adventurers guild we try to unearth the area's treasures and even discovered the remains of a mysterious civilisation that has become extinct long ago. ...  
Gnomcruiter: Our greatest accomplishment yet was the discovery of the so called exaltation forge. ...  
Gnomcruiter: Our gnomish scientists made the thing work and the adventurers' guild transported it to one of their bases. ...  
Gnomcruiter: And we can only guess what other discoveries await us. ...  
Gnomcruiter: As of now though, our operation has run into problems. That's where you come into play. ...  
Gnomcruiter: We are looking for experienced people that want to join our efforts.  
Player: join  
Gnomcruiter: Great! Consider yourself conscripted. ...  
Gnomcruiter: So get to the steamboat on that isle ... I guess you call it Cormaya, and ask for a passage to Gnomprona. ...  
Gnomcruiter: Talk to Gnominer, the leader of our operations in Gnomprona. He will tell you where your help is needed most.
