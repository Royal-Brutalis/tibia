Player: Hi  
Yoem: Hello Player! Do you need some equipment for your house?  
Player: Name  
Yoem: My name is Yoem. I sell furniture and equipment.  
Player: Job  
Yoem: Have you moved to a new home? I'm the specialist for equipping it.  
Player: Daniel Steelsoul  
Yoem: Yes, I know him since we were small children. He's a brave and virtuous man.  
Player: Curse  
Yoem: Yes, the Curse of the Full Moon has reached Cormaya, too. More and more people are affected but something is really strange: Some of them weren't bitten by were-beasts. So far we thought this is the only way to be infected. ...  
Yoem: But now it's obvious that there has to be another way. If you ask me: I guess it's the ground water. Someone has to enter the caverns underneath Cormaya and investigate. ...  
Yoem: In the east of the island there are tunnels where we often spot were-beasts at night. Perhaps you should start there.  
Player: Curse  
Yoem: So I was right, it is the ground water! Please try to reverse this contamination. Unfortunately, I don't know anything about magic or arcane matters. But you could ask somebody at the Magic Academy of Edron.  
Player: Curse  
Yoem: You succeeded! Thank you very much for your help, my friend. Please return to Edron and tell Daniel Steelsoul about it, he will be interested in this outcome, too.  
Player: Bye  
Yoem: Good bye, Player.
