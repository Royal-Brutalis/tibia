Player: hi  
Ghostly Wolf: You are speaking the language of animals? I'm surprised. But I'm not in the right mood for a chat.  
Player: mood  
Ghostly Wolf: I'm heartbroken. My puppies were taken from me ... But as I said, I don't want to talk right now. Please leave me alone.  
Player: name  
Ghostly Wolf: My name is long forgotten.  
Player: job  
Ghostly Wolf: I'm a wolf ... or I was one. Now I'm a ghost, haunting this place because I can't find peace.  
Player: time  
Ghostly Wolf: Time is not important, neither to wolves nor to ghosts.  
Player: bye  
Ghostly Wolf: Farewell.
