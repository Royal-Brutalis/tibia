Fayla: <smiles> Yes, dear? Do you want to buy something?  
Player: yes  
Fayla: <smiles> Well then, just ask for a trade and have a look!  
Player: job  
Fayla: During office hours, I sell instruments. In the evenings and by appointment, I teach how to sing and to play an instrument.  
Player: teach  
Player: lesson  
Fayla: Not everyone here can afford his or her own instrument, and I enjoy music. So I made it my duty to teach all who strive to sing and play. After all, music is there to be shared.  
Player: singer / opera  
Fayla: Ah, so you heard of me? Well, a lot of time has passed since then, my dear. Glorious days, but it doesn’t do to repine, does it? Of course it doesn’t. <smiles> …  
Fayla: Now, how about a nice little instrument for your home? Just ask me for a trade and I’ll set you right up.  
Player: wooden / flute  
Fayla: That was a gift from a very mighty and noble friend. Ah, I could never part with it!  
Player: sell / buy / instrument / music  
Fayla: I sell only the finest instruments, if you are interested in a trade.  
Player: city / Rathleton  
Fayla: This is an …interesting city, as I am sure you have already noticed. I believe you know glooth?  
Player: glooth  
Fayla: A strange substance that pervades every aspect of city life. Scientists study it, engineers construct with it… in short, it is used for many purposes.

Fayla: Good bye.
