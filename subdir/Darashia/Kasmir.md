Player: Hi  
Kasmir: May Daraman enlighten you Player!  
Player: Job  
Kasmir: I am a chosen of Daraman.  
Player: Name  
Kasmir: Kasmir Ibn Darasir.  
Player: Caliph  
Kasmir: The caliph is heavily involved in the affairs in the world, but one has to make this sacrifice for the welfare of all.  
Player: Daraman  
Kasmir: Daraman travelled the world and learned the secrets of the ancients. At last he learned the secret of ascension and founded his philosophy.  
Player: Darama  
Kasmir: This land is harsh and challenging. It's far away from temptations and delusions. Here Daraman's people can concentrate on themselves.  
Player: Ascension  
Kasmir: Daraman had a vision that all mortals are able to ascend to heaven, becoming celestial beings.  
Player: Celestial Beings  
Kasmir: By enhancing one's soul a mortal can ascend to heaven. If you are not prepared to ascend, you are bound to this world by reincarnation.  
Player: Reincarnation  
Kasmir: If your soul is not strong and purified, you will not ascend but return to life on death, even losing strength in the process.  
Player: Life  
Kasmir: Life is divine though not without flaws.  
Player: Philosophy  
Kasmir: Daraman led his followers to this promised land to follow his teachings. It was named Darama after him later.  
Player: Necromancers  
Kasmir: Undeath is even worse than reincarnation. Those souls are nothing but a rotting mockery of a soul on the path of ascension.  
Player: Quest  
Kasmir: Your quest should be to prepare your soul for ascension.  
Player: Urgith  
Kasmir: The bonemaster is strong in the ruins of Drefia. There you can test the braveness of your soul ... or lose it to his minions.  
Player: Soul  
Kasmir: The soul was made by the gods and therefore is divine. So by enhancing its divinity it can become more like the image of its creators.  
Player: Banor  
Kasmir: Banor is the very proof that ascension is possible.  
Player: Gods  
Kasmir: The gods are in heaven and far away. You are here. So concentrate on your soul and take care for it on your own.  
Player: Excalibug  
Kasmir: Your greed for such items can easily corrupt your soul.  
Player: Koshei  
Kasmir: My grandfather knew him and he always lowered his voice when he spoke his name. I don't know many things about this strange fellow but ...  
Kasmir: ...wait, now I remember. My grandfather said something about an amulet with great power. Rumour says that it shattered and that one of the four pieces killed Koshei. ...  
Kasmir: Actually noone knows if that is true or not.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Kasmir: His soul is corrupted beyond any hope for ascension.  
Player: Ruthless Seven  
Kasmir: They are soulless and therefore without true power in the end.  
Player: Sells  
Kasmir: Go to the bazaar if you are interested in worldly wealth.  
Player: Uman  
Kasmir: Uman is the positive aspect of magic. His powers flow through each Tibian, making us his children.  
Player: Zathroth  
Kasmir: Zathroth is the corruptor of souls who does not want mortals to ascend and become more like him.  
Player: Fardos  
Kasmir: Fardos is the creator. It was his work that we possess divine souls.  
Player: News  
Kasmir: Don't look for news when you don't know the past.  
Player: Tibiasula  
Kasmir: The world is only a portal the gods created to allow our ascension to heaven.  
Player: Brog  
Kasmir: Brog's hot blood is in our veins, tempting us and distracting us from improvement of our souls.  
Player: Kirok  
Kasmir: Kirok is called the mad one. He gifted us with the creativity to achive our ascension.  
Player: Toth  
Kasmir: Toth is the final judge. The unworthy are condemened to reincarnation.  
Player: Suon  
Kasmir: Suon is the sun. He watches our ascension.  
Player: Fafnar  
Kasmir: Fafnar is a test for our endurance and dilligence.  
Player: Crunor  
Kasmir: Crunor is the force of life and part of our all being.  
Player: Nornur  
Kasmir: Nornur is the mysterious god of fate. Daraman taught us that he is the judge who allows ascension.  
Player: Bastesh  
Kasmir: Bastesh is the goddess of the seas, and deep as the see is our soul, indeed.  
Player: Sula  
Kasmir: Sula is the raw force of water.  
Player: Air  
Kasmir: Air is without true mind and meaning.  
Player: how are you?  
Kasmir: Thank you, I'm fine and my soul is strong.  
Player: donation  
Kasmir: Do you want to make a donation?  
Player: yes  
Kasmir: May Daraman guide your quest for ascension.  
Player: sins  
Kasmir: Do you whish to confess your sins?  
Player: yes  
Kasmir: So what does trouble your soul, pilgrim?  
Player: (Fale anything)  
Kasmir: Meditate on that and try harder to improve soul.  
Player: Bye  
Kasmir: Good bye, Player. May Daraman's all-seeing eye watch your travels!
