Jack: Mh...  
Jack: Could it be...? No. No way.  
Jack: So much to do, so little time, they say...  
Player: hi  
Jack: They won't believe me anymore, they just won't believe me. Well, my sis is slowly accepting that this was all a lie. I don't know about my mother, though.  
Player: job  
Jack: Well, currently I don't have any occupation. Besides my love for sculpting sulky sculptures, like the one in the back there.  
Player: name  
Jack: My name is Jack. What's your name? Ah yes, Player.  
Player: mother  
Jack: Sometimes, when I really need some time for myself, I take a walk outside. Somehow she always thinks I am up to something when I'm not here. Or maybe she just doesn't want to lose me. But why? I always came back, didn't I.  
Player: sister / jane  
Jack: Well, she is a little older than me and I believe she thinks mother favours me in some way because I am the youngest. I wouldn't know for sure, however. And mother always keeps her busy. Not that she'd never complain, though.  
Player: jack  
Jack: That's me alright. Any problems with that? No? Thought so.  
Player: time  
Jack: It's about horas.  
Player: spectulus  
Jack: Gesundheit! It seems you caught quite a cold.  
Jack: I... was... sculpting sulky sculptures. For all my life. Until you came in here and DESTROYED MY MASTERPIECE. Go away. I don't like you.  
Player: thais  
Jack: Mh, never been that far.  
Player: tibia  
Jack: I don't care about much outside of my home here in Edron. And why should I even.  
Player: king / tibianus  
Jack: Well, Tibianus is a good king as far as I can tell. On the other hand, I don't care about him much as long as I can do what I like to whenever I want to.  
Player: edron  
Jack: Yep, that's my home. Nice city and all. Been here all my life, don't intend changing this.  
Player: army  
Jack: Good to know that they're there to defend us. I for one would never join the army, though.  
Player: excalibug  
Jack: Never heard about that.  
Player: news / rumor / rumour  
Jack: Don't know. Guess it just doesn't happen much in these parts.  
Player: bye  
Jack: Yes yes. Goodbye Player.
