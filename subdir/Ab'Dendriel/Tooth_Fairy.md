Player: hi  
Tooth Fairy: Greetings, human being.  
Player: mission  
Tooth Fairy: You've got me, I really have a little problem here. What gave it away? My sorrowful expression? Yes, I thought so. This is what troubles me: I'm the tooth fairy. Well, this wouldn't be a problem at all under normal circumstances. ...  
Tooth Fairy: I love gathering children's milk teeth and bringing presents for them. Until now, I did so by using a spell. This spell teleported me into the children's bedrooms and - after carrying out my duty - back to my secret realm. ...  
Tooth Fairy: But then I made the mistake of using a magical portal and entering this part of the world. Everything is strange and different here and the worst thing: my spells don't work! It will take some time until I can use the portal again. ...  
Tooth Fairy: Thus I'm stuck here for a while. But there are some children who lost their first milk tooth and are now waiting for their presents. Without my spells, I'm feeling utterly helpless. ...  
Tooth Fairy: I don't dare going to their homes at night but I know they will be sad about the missing presents. Would you help me?  
Player: yes  
Tooth Fairy: Thank you very much, human being! You have to find three children: Quero's daughter in Thais, Allen's son in Venore and Rowenna's daughter in Carlin. Go to their bedrooms and find their milk teeth. ...  
Tooth Fairy: Usually they put them on their bed stands. Then you have to put the gifts on their beds. Please take these presents and go to Thais, Carlin and Venore. Come back with the milk teeth.  
Player: mission  
Tooth Fairy: You're bringing the milk teeth! Thank you, human being; you were of great assistance to me! Please take this in return. It's the part of a map. If you find the other parts, it will show you the way to a hidden fairy treasure. ...  
Tooth Fairy: Oh, and if you're interested, there's still another cause you could help me with.  
Player: cause  
Tooth Fairy: As I'm the tooth fairy it should not surprise you to hear that I have a small collection. Yes, a tooth collection, of course. But I'm still lacking some special specimens. ...  
Tooth Fairy: I would give you a little reward if you bring me one of the following - or all of them: an orc tooth, a shark tooth, a vampire tooth, a behemoth fang, a carrion worm fang or a werewolf fangs.  
Player: orc  
Tooth Fairy: Oh, I see! You really found an orc tooth for me! Thank you, human being! Please take this in return.  
Player: shark  
Tooth Fairy: Oh, I see! You really found shark teeth for me! Thank you, human being! Please take this in return.  
Player: vampire  
Tooth Fairy: Oh, I see! You really found vampire teeth for me! Thank you, human being! Please take this in return.  
Player: behemoth  
Tooth Fairy: Oh, I see! You really found a behemoth fang for me! Thank you, human being! Please take this in return.  
Player: carrion worm  
Tooth Fairy: Oh, I see! You really found a carrion worm fang for me! Thank you, human being! Please take this in return. Player: werewolf  
Tooth Fairy: Oh, I see! You really found werewolf fangs for me! Thank you, human being! Please take this in return.
