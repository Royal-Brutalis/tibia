Upon reaching adulthood, the young elf gets his first name, divined by the elders who\nknow him in dreams. It is merely a single name, a description of the elf in the elven tongue. Usually elves love to add a translation of their name which is often mistaken for a second name by other races. Since the elven language is far more complicated and has thousands of nuances, often elves with the same 'second name' have a different first name, confusing the other races even more."

Inhuman sources tell of several armies that invaded our world in the course of many centuries.\nMost of these invasions could be tracked to some unholy centre of magic. From there immense forces were evoked to open a gate through which the demonic armies entered our world.\nThe gate was opened, an army passed through, and the gate eventually closed again. The invading armies had no supplies and were finally destroyed. The demonic leaders made only rare appearances on the battlefield, probably summoned by their minions for a while. So contrary to common belief, it seems possible that a large demonic army enters our world if certain conditions are met. It should be our top priority to find out what conditions this may be."

Hunted by countless enemies and almost everytime outnumbered when it came to fights with 'neighbours' they retreated into the deepest woods where the greater number of their foes was evened out. There they created encampments they visited now and then. They had contact with many creatures and cultures. They adopted ideas and inventions that suited their nomadic lifestyle and begun even a very cautious trade with other races to aquire things they were not able to build on their own. As the attention of the other races turned more and more away from the elves and wars broke out between them, some of the elves begun to live at their up to then only part time ecampment on a permanent base. Adopting what they had seen from other races and things they vaguely remembered from their own past some trading posts were established in this way. Usually only one to three families lived there. After the reunification with the Cenath the majority of them could be convinced to give a permanent settlement a try and the biggest tradingpost became the settlement Ab'Dendriel. Some families refused to join their brethren and continued to wander the world, only visiting the city now and then, each vistit convincing them more that they have only little in common with the Deraisim anymore. So they begun to see themselves as Abdaisim and continued to be the nomads and restless wanderers of elvenkind."

The minotaurs withdrew from the wars, but in a world gone mad, skirmishes with other races were part of their daily routine. The demise of the whole race continued.

This class of minotaurs was the only one who could live long enough to learn skills not directly connected to war. Since they were almost always the only ones who could gather enough experience and wisdom to create new ideas and concepts, the younger warriors begun to look at them as parents and advisors. Slowly these elders were able to change the war culture of the minotaurs. One charismatic minotaur in particular, Akkor, who was born blind, became the founder of the new minotaurian philosophy. He shunned the rage as a curse of the god Blog. Consequently, the minotaurian religion, which due to the extremity of martyrdom and rage never had a real chance to develop, turned away from the raging one. Slowly new concepts were adopted and great efforts were undertaken to hold the rage at bay. Meditation and self-control became the foremost duties of any warrior. The minotaurian ideal turned towards role models who were in control of body and mind. Since fiery rage was in minotaurian nature, young minotaurs were trained from early on to control themselves. It was through meditation that the minotaurs developed art and soon philosophy. Complicated ceremonies for usually simple things of daily life were developed to focus the mind, to be aware of each second of life."

The warriors of the uppermost class are usually so well educated they control some amount of magic, often used to augment their own strength and defense. They are the heroes and role models of the lower class. The minotaurs still have a warrior culture, but the understanding of a true warrior has changed dramatically.\nMinotaur cheese is a specialty, often envied by decadent human nobles."

        "text": "The Blood Curse\nSages claim that we owe vampires to the dark deeds of some gods or demons. Some say, Urgith created them as a new tool for his wars. Others believe that vampires are an undead variation created by some powerful but not godlike being, very likely by one of the Ruthless Seven. Some think vampires are made by the Lord of the undead, other see Verminor as their creator. Again others see vampirism as some kind of curse.\nIt is said that the first vampire was a powerful warrior king who successfully fought the undead in the Corpse War. Being promised forbidden power and unification with his beloved ones, a once loyal follower of the king became the pawn of the dark powers. He poisoned his liege, probably over several months, using some nasty mixture which was handed to him.\nAs the king became sick and no one was able to heal him, the traitor stepped forward with a strange medicine. Trusting in his beloved servant, the king drank the medicine which actually was the blood of some servant that had been murdered recently. The medicine seemed to restore the king's strength, so the traitor had no trouble to feed him with more blood. Soon the king's appearance started to change. His aversion to sunlight and his paleness were attributed to his illness, but also the king's temper and behaviour turned more and more violent and aggressive. Nonetheless, the people loved their king and put up with his moods.\nThe traitor fuelled the king's growing paranoia with lies, so it was easy to convince him to get rid of certain court members. One by one the loyal advisers were removed and replaced with dark cultists. When the king was cut off from any loyal support, they stopped to give him blood and his illness returned, even worse than before. When he convulsed in pain and agony, they presented him a peasant to drain blood from. Almost insane by his ravenous thirst, the king accepted this sinister gift. As soon as he realised what was happening, he went berserk. In a fit of rage, he slaughtered each and every cultist that he encountered, but in the end they trapped him in his castle. The survivors fled with the corpse of the peasant who soon rose as a vampire. They drained him of his dark blood and killed him. Then they drank the blood to become vampires themselves.\nThe king was finally freed by loyal subjects. He had turned into something he had fought his whole life - an undead. It is said he left his castle in that very night, some say to hunt the traitors, others claim to end his undead life."

As far as I see it, the human body is all but a catalyst for a most formidable transformation. With the transformation an all new world of opportunities and impressions awaits.\nIt is an awakening. Several things, such as coldness and tiredness cease to exist for a vampire.\nThe focus of existence is no longer bound to tiresome daily routines and can be aimed at something bigger and more important. The weak and fragile mortal body becomes a sophisticated tool that does not lose its function due to illness or old age.\nSeeing the mortals suffer under such influences alienates a vampire somewhat from humanity and makes it ever more clear that we are different.\nHumans and vampires are set apart from each other. \nWe remember mortality and see its weaknesses. We mourn the mortals even though our highly evolved existence raises us high above them. The wisdom we gain with our age is great. Freed of the shackles of mortality we have a clearer view of things. Knowing the envious fear with which some greedy and selfish humans view us, we hide from the eyes of overzealous inquisitors and clergymen.\nBehind the scenes we guide the humans through history, supporting the worthy and eliminating threats to humanity. We are the unseen movers and makers that hold kingdoms together, furthering ideas that improve societies and boosting discoveries.\nNot for gratitude, but to fulfil the obligation of passing some of our fortune on to those that are not as fortunate.\nA selected few grasp our status and have the greatness to live with their inferiority. In their own meek way they try to help us in our noble efforts. They are worthy above all others to become one of us one day. We do not take new vampires lightly of course. It can be a challenging and long journey to join our ranks. With diligence and intelligence a human might eventually convince a vampire of his worth."

It is believed by elvenkind that in their history seven elven lords acquired the status of celestial paladins and therefore are godlike beings. Worshipping them is a very personal matter though. It is certain that different high lords are more prominent in different castes but prayers and interpretation of the high lords is only shared on family level at best, usually each elf finds his own approach to some of the high lords, completely ignoring the other ones.\nMortiur - the ravager, prominent for some sects. The avenger, merciless against friend, foe and himself\nNera - the lady of spring (flowers, growth) completely replacing Crunor for some elves.\nDseyvar - the sworddancer, responsible for the grace of the warrior, elven warriors have to be graceful not chivalrous.\nPriyla - the daughter of the stars, mystery and magic\nKrynierr - the silver tongue, poetry, love and music\nAzmoda - the vieled one, mysterious figure.

        "text": "The Seeds of Life\nSpring is the time when the powers of the vital force are strongest. It is this time of the year when everything is growing and nature is vibrant of life. But not only nature is growing and giving birth, also the pure force of life is pulsating with energy and the power of creation. This energy often enters in living beings, making them stronger, healthier, and more fertile. Sometimes it enters in seeds of the most diverse plants. No one can tell what kind of plant may grow from these seeds, but many creatures instinctively feel the vital force in the seeds and collect them. Some creatures of nature think of these seeds as holy relics. They cannot stand the thought that those who they regard as defilers of nature could gain possession of such seeds. Therefore, the activity of those who see themselves as preservers of nature is unusually high in spring.\nDryads and other creatures of nature who are hardly ever seen for the rest of the year suddenly appear in great numbers and often pose a threat to unwary travellers of the woods. The fact that the powers of the vital force infuse them with additional energy makes matters only worse. For some time, whole forests might be impassable while the trees seem to come alive. Roots try to snare and trap travellers, walls of rapidly growing tendrils and thorns block passages, and dryads and tree spirits ambush exhausted and tired travellers. Still, not all dryads are that hostile. Some of them are even willing to trade these special seeds for other items or help the finder to cultivate the seed into a magnificent plant. Sadly such helpful spirits are rare and as capricious as all dryads. So you never can be sure what exactly to expect from them.\nStories are abound in which dryads deal seemingly peacefully with humans only to turn them into trees once they have earned their trust. Other stories tell about dryads that kidnapped humans and took them into their homes in some ancient tree where they had to work as servants forever. There are even stories about people who went to the dryads to trade with them or get some advice, and when they returned from their trips which had only lasted a few days, years or even decades had passed in their hometown. Of course most of these stories are fairy tales, exaggerations or outright lies, but mortals are well-advised to be extremely careful when dealing with dryads."

        "text": "About Feyrist\nFeyrist is mainly populated by Fae. Rumour has it that it is located north-west of Roshamuul, bordered between high mountains to the southeast and the sea to the other cardinal directions. Deep forests and lush meadows are mixing up on the peninsula, dotted with lakes, brooks, hills, ravines and groves. The coast of Feyrist is partly sandy beaches, partly grassy shores. Feyrist has a temperate to warm climate, which has led to a lush, verdurous vegetation. Rich green pastures with various wild flowers and thick deciduous forests are dominating the peninsula. Most of the Fae live scattered all over the woods, there is just one bigger settlement, consisting of many Fae houses, a magical fountain and a tree that seems to be some kind of temple.\nFeyrist arose from the mortals' pleasant dreams. The reclusive magical realm is among the most secret areas of Tibia, characterised by an enchanted environment and pervaded by ancient magic. The Fae's skills of shaping wood and stone as well as their magical talent are their greatest benefits. The woods of Feyrist hold some rare magical plants. However, Feyrist lacks almost all infrastructure, simply because the fae don't have any need for it.\nThe Fae of Feyrist are forming different courts. Although not all of them belong to a fairy court, many of them do. Usually, the most powerful female fae is the leader of a court. Sometimes she refers to herself as queen. The queen is supported by several knights, male and female alike, who are acting as her personal guards as well as the court's defenders. Within a court there may be disagreements among single members, but overt struggles are rather uncommon. The courts are independent from each other. Conflicts between two courts are seldom.\nThe Fae are benevolent but also flighty and unpredictable creatures. They are more interested in dancing, making music and playing tricks on each other than in fighting, studying or constructing. Fae like sweets, wine, glittering trinkets, lyrics and music. The highest purpose in a Fae's life is usually to have fun and to live a carefree life. Some Fae are suspicious of strangers and tend to welcome them with avoidance in the best case. They feel foreigners disturb the area's solitude. Lately, however, one of the courts has shown some interest in the mortals, how the Fae call all strangers.\nThe Fae also have a spiritual side and perform various rites to celebrate the moon cycle and certain weather phenomena. They don't worship gods or greater spirits but nature itself, which they regard as a kind of supreme being. Apart from that, Fae care only for the here and now. Fae possess a distinct talent for the arcane powers and they have highly developed artisanal skills when it comes to shaping wood and stone. It is unclear whether the Fae have to eat in order to survive. However, they obviously enjoy eating sweets and fresh fruit as well as drinking wine.  So it can be assumed that they do it just for pleasure."

        "text": "About the Fae\nThe Fae are secluded and mysterious creatures, living in forests, some of them also in caves beneath the earth. Their secret realm is the peninsula Feyrist. There is a less forested meadow area, which borders on the mountain chain, that seems to separate Feyrist from Roshamuul. A large forest is situated in the centre, here and there are small hills and clearings. Again and again one can discover bright crystal formations and in between, there are smaller rivers and lakes.\nThe Fae do not build any real cities, but inhabit trees, big mushrooms or huge snail shells. There are also tree houses and dwellings made of thick trunks. The Fae can shape wood and stone, so even large rocks may become houses. The Fae often decorate their glades and homes with flowers, tendrils and crystals.\nMany flowers, butterflies etc. indicate that the Fae are in close touch with nature. In addition, there are magical ponds and wells, mushroom circles and fairylike plants.\nThe Fae are mystical creatures that wield magical and elemental powers. They vary greatly in size and appearance. There are different kinds of fae like fauns, pixies, pookas, swan maidens and boogies. Most Fae are rather reclusive and live peaceful lives in their secret realm.  They only leave this realm when it is necessary, i.e. in the case of existential threats to their island. In order to protect their home, they can get quite fierce and resolute. In Feyrist though they are mostly playful and cheery. They rarely use arms, but if they do, the weapons are made of wood and stone.\nThe Fae believe that they will die or that their secret realm will be destroyed if strangers enter the island. For this reason, they live very secluded and protect their realm with a magical barrier from the outside world. Strangers are rarely granted access. If at all, then only after proving their trustworthiness.\nThe Fae know much about humans, elves and dwarves, the beings from whose dreams they mainly arise. Therefore, these races are more familiar to them than orcs, trolls or minotaurs. They know them, but only very rarely they also arise from their dreams. Members of other races seem to be either unable to enter the island or immediately sent back through dream portals."

Their hideouts were additionally protected by strong illusionary magic and offered them peace from the madness around them. These elves developed due to meditation and a special philosophy in the art of dream magic, dramatically enhancing their initial abilities in the decades. So they began to exist almost permanently in a state of dreams, only rarely appearing now and then amidst the other elves to give them advice and try to convince some of them to join their way of life. As the war grew more and more fierce these visits became less and less frequent until they were almost a myth, even for elvenkind. In the new awakening of the world they were some of the First to appear, apparently far less disoriented then other beings. Many races welcomed their help, but their teachings seldom found dedicated listeners. After they taught a part of their secrets to some humans they found worthy, they had to see their pupils tortured by developments they judged themselves guilty of. Also, other elves put pressure on the humans to give up the secrets of dreams. They withdrew from the world of mortals and it is rumored they have physically entered the realm of dreams. The Teshial are 'typical' in appearance for elves, but they could create the illusion of almost any appearance if they so choose. Some people even say that due to their enormous control of dreams they could shape their children as they wish, giving them human or even orcish appearance. On the other hand, even people who come up with such theories go silent when asked why an elf should choose to have a child that looks that way."

Sunlight will dry them out and even turn them into dust. If you drive a wooden object into the heart of a vampire, the flow of the vampire's tainted blood is stopped, leaving him completely helpless. It should be mentioned, though, that if the heart is partly missed or if the object is not large enough, the vampire might still be able to move.\nSince a vampire is dead anyway, none of these methods allows to destroy a vampire for good. With enough time and blood, a vampire can recover from any of those seeming deaths. The only known way to permanently defeat a vampire is to kill him with a blessed stake. A blessed stake, however, is a rare object that cannot be obtained easily."

This magic changes appearance and personality slightly, allowing elven parents to give birth to 'wish-kids'. In their shared dreams the elven parents seem to sculpture their child like a piece of art. Though most of the dream magic of the past is long forgotten, this rudimentary magic seems to be natural to the elves. It is possible to 'choose' things like hair or eye color and even gender. Even slight changes of the physique are possible, though considerable changes take place in the span of generations. Wise men assume this ability was a 'gift' of the gods to make more adaptable tools for the elves' war. But the mentality of the elves did not allow them to form their children in a 'convenient' way. Since most of this magic is instinctual, they form their children in an aesthetic way. On the other hand, what is seen as aesthetic is based on the philosophy of the parents and so their background changes this view dramatically. This is even more evident in the castes that were separated in the war."

The shamans develop this ability to such an extent, that they can sense the innermost potential of newborn orc whelps. All newborn are tested and the shamans decide a future function in orcish society. The whelps are fed differently, raised differently, and educated differently. Wise men of other races say that such behavior is similar to some insects, such as bees, and through their empathetic bond might share a kind of 'hive-mind', so they refer to orc communities as hives. The chief of a hive owns a big harem of women who have no other function than to pleasure him and give birth to new orcs. These orcish matrons are usually incredibly big and fat, almost not able to walk on their own. Where 'normal' orcwomen function as laborer and craftwomen and give birth to two to three orcs in their lives, these female orcs are only reproductive machinery, giving birth to about six whelps each half year. Orcs are usually contend with their place in orcish society and only the leaders fight each other on purpose. Rarely will an orc raise a weapon against another orc, even if they are not of the same hive. Rivalry between hives is usually dissolved through a fight of their leaders and the victorious hive absorbs the other one. Now and then, when a new strong warrior reaches maturity he challenges the old leader for a fight of supremacy. Sometimes though, when the hive becomes too big for the area it occupies, such a warrior senses somehow that its time to move on. Then he and a few other orcs leave the hive in peace to settle somewhere else. This unique culture, together with its fertility, makes the orcs the most formidable threat to all other tibian communities."

Protective shells were created, spells to deflect damage, enchantements to keep harm away. The 'return' was aweful. Almost half of the elves perished.

The battered elves retreated and begun to wander aimlessly through the lands, until they encountered scouts of the\nDeraisim\nwho led them to the safety of their woods.

        "text": "The Rise of the Pumpkin\nAfter many wars and always new threats by the forces of darkness, humanity was afraid of many things. It was no cowardice but a gnawing fear that slowly eroded courage and faith. The servants of evil seemed to appear everywhere and in many horrible forms. Humans had grown accustomed to be afraid of the dark and the unknown. This weakened their resolve and with that also the forces of good. The gods came together to find a way to rise the spirit of humanity once again. They discussed and debated but could not come to an agreement because their views were too contrasting. And while they still deliberated, suddenly one of their least and minor creations stood amongst them. It was the lord of the rabbit race who had passed unnoticed by the mighty guardians. Without fear the little rabbit faced the gods who looked upon him in astonishment. Then the lord of the rabbits proposed his idea to the mighty and great gods. Since rabbits are tiny and their enemies are many, they are quite familiar with fear and how to handle it. So the lord of the rabbits came up with the idea to have the humans overcome their fear by learning to laugh in the face of evil. The gods were amazed by this simple but clever idea. So they chose the mightiest warrior of the rabbit race and bestowed magical powers upon him. The daring hare gained the protection of the gods and the power to disguise humans with hideous appearances of monsters. Each year, the hare would appear for some time and do his work. So the humans learnt to laugh and had fun while appearing as monsters, and the great fear that had darkened the souls of humans gradually vanished.\nThis enraged the forces of evil and so they called forth the most malevolent spirit from the realm of darkness. It was his task to spread fear among mankind once again. The spirit was sent to take possession of the greatest living hero among the humans and to wreak havoc in the name of darkness. Unbeknownst to them, the lord of the rabbits had anticipated that the forces of evil would strike back. So he had sent some spies to the realm of darkness and learnt about their plan in time. He warned the humans about the approaching danger and once again had the right plan to save the day. He asked the humans to build a puppet clad in a shining armor and to put it on a throne in the midst of their festivities. As the puppet's head served a pumpkin with a carved face. The clever hare had figured that a spirit from the depths of the realm of darkness was not familiar with humans and would assume the figure on a throne in the centre of festivities as humanity's greatest hero. And indeed he was proven right when the spirit arrived and tried to possess what he assumed a human body. But the spirit had immense powers and so he finally managed to take possession of the pumpkin head on the cost of nearly all of his powers. With hardly any power left, the spirit made the pumpkin move and began to attack the celebrating humans. But the humans had long regained their courage and were not afraid to fight back. They drove off the evil pumpkin that escaped to some remote place where he was finally banished from the world. It took the spirit one year to regain enough of his strength to fight his way back into reality. He re-entered the world at the place of his defeat and to his shock and dismay he was no longer a spirit but bound to a pumpkin-like body. The beast roared in rage but could do little about it. Again he tried to wreak havoc in the world but again valiant heroes stopped his rampage and banished him for another year. Since this day on, the spirit returns every year hoping that one day humanity will be weakened enough for him to finally take revenge."

Most beasts that could live in such livethreatening circumstances were that powerfull that direct attacks proved to be futile. So the elves begun to develop a more devious way to fight, with assaults, traps and hit and run tactics. After over hundred years they had enough resources to leave the burning lands and adopted their way of live to their new enviroment. So they became the secretive people under the hills. They were fierce fighters whenever their new home was threatened. Some hundred years they fought off all intruders until their explorers made contact with the other remaining elven casts. Under the growing pressure of the more and more powerful waves of orcish attacks they left their homes to join forces with the other elves in an uneasy alliance. Their apperance had changed to a even more slender Version of the normal elves. Their skin is very pale, their hair pure white or pitch black. The younger members of that cast often color strands of their hair in unusual clors like red, blue or purple. Red, albinotic eyes are common, but in general all kinds of eyecolors are existent."

Their eyes are often pale blue or green, sometimes a faint yellow. They have long black hair, or sometimes dark brown. They seem to live nowadays in the region northwest of Carlin and are seen quite often there. They have the keenest eyes of the elves, and the weapons of their choice are spears, knives and sometimes the short bow. They are fine hunters and sometimes trade furs, but the main part of their life remains yet uncertain."

But Shehamin, the second wife of the pharaoh, was not a woman to be fooled easily. Using cleverness and charm she brought his schemes to light and told her husband about them. Esuph III was furious, and his verdict on the fraudulent tax inspector was as cruel as it was clever: The screaming tax collector was sunk into a cauldron full of boiling gold. The terribly distorted statue which as the result of this peculiar treatment was put up in the tax office as a grim reminder that fraud can seriously affect your health. The gold that was stolen by the tax collector, however, was never found, and to this day there are many who dream about finding the unfaithful tax collector's hidden treasure."

So full of himself was he, so firm in his heretic opinions and yet such a slave to his flesh - how could he understand that which is true and holy? People like him are both a curse and a blessing to us, the children of enlightenment. They may insult and provoke us with their ignorance, yet it is when we meet fools like him that we realise the full extent of the glorious state of enlightenment we live in. Far from ascension though we are, we have been granted the opportunity to achieve what will be forever denied to people like him - divinity!"

Thahon could not bring forth convincing proof of her guilt and was sentenced to ten blows on his bare feet. The crafter Ziril claimed that the beggar Aukohl stole a cake from his open window. Although no proof was found there was a general sense of agreement that no proof was necessary since everybody was convinced of the beggar's guilt. In a rare display of mercy the judge sentenced him to a mere three years of work in the salt mines. The widow Zehmahil claimed that the travelling bard Todd Ballory had promised here mariage in exchange for certain services that have not been further elaborated on in the court's documents. The foreigner was found guilty without trial and sentenced to three years of work in the salt mines. The footsoldier Kamahl claimed his father Indril was guilty of witchcraft. Several obscure texts were found beneath the accused person's bed. Indril was banished from the city and his property was equally divided between the pharaoh and his heirs. The foreigner Todd Ballory was pronounced guilty of killing the overseer Barnak, a father of sixteen children and a respectable member of the local whipcrackers' association. The aforementioned convict was sentenced to a rather spectacular final appearance in the local arena."

It was a marvel to behold, made of black glass and gold, and everybody who looked at it was filled with an eerie sense of foreboding. The vizier was rumoured to be so powerful that no one dared to bring him to justice. Even Rahmen Tah himself feared the power of his vizier, and he did not dare to send troops against the vizier. Finally he called for his chief astrologer and mathematician, the wise Athem, and asked him for advice. Athem listened quietly to the words of his pharaoh. After he had finished Athem ask his pharaoh for some time to think everything over. Reluctantly the pharaoh agreed."

The pharaoh who trusted in the wisdom of his advisor ordered his people to prepare for the celebration. While the people did as their pharaoh had ordered them to do Athem began to build a huge wooden machine on top of the royal pyramid. No one took much notice of it because of the preparations that were going on. On the fourth day when the celebration was scheduled to start the pharaoh sent an invitation to his vizier and asked him to join in their festivity. As Athem had foreseen the vizier declined because he suspected that there was a trap. Instead he sat in the observatory at the top of his tower and watched the city because he wanted to find out what the pharaoh was up to. Too late did he understand that the construct on top of the pyramid was in fact an enormous catapult. Suddenly a huge boulder was hurled in his direction. The shot had been perfectly calculated, and it hit its mark with amazing precision. The top of the dark tower shattered and the evil vizier was crushed underneath tons of basalt. His death caused the dark magic to disappear, and the tower sank into the ocean forever."

More dead than alive was he when he was found in the desert, and the merchants who found him took pity on him and brought him hither. But how great was the amazement and the wonder when it turned out that he wore a birth-mark on his neck that looked exactly like a scarab! The crowd was struck with awe, and it was soon decided that he was to be taken to the priests, so that they might ask the gods for an omen. And so it came that while the man was still lying in a slumber full of delirious dreams the priests burnt incense and performed the ancient rituals to ask the gods for advice and for guidance. The high priest climbed the highest pyramid and called for the knowledge of the wind and the wisdom of the sand. For three long days the stranger was caught in the perilous lands that separate life from death, and for three long days the priest was haunted by visions. But when those days had passed, everything changed. All of a sudden the stranger opened his eyes and looked around in amazement, and it was that very moment that the delirious priest began to utter a prophecy."

But much to their dismay he could not give them the answers they sought, for his memory seemed to be blank like the surface of the desert after a sandstorm. However, the priests had the wisdom of the secret prophecy to guide them, and so they knew that they had to give the strangers five tasks to fulfil before they could reveal his destiny to him. And so they did, and the stranger swore he would fulfil all the tasks or die in the attempt. His first task was to travel into the desert and to find the eldest of the scarabs there, so that the priests would reveal their wisdom to him and fill his empty mind with recollections. The stranger descended deep into the burrows of the scarabs in order to face their judgement and to find answers that had been lost in the desert sand aeons ago. But the stranger never returned."

But just before the raging monsters could put their claws on her a flying carpet swept down from the sky and rescued both the mother and her child. The Thaian nobleman - for who else would it be but him - somehow managed to evade the hails of arrows that greeted him, and so the couple managed to make their escape northwards. The pharaoh demanded that both the nobleman and his own unfaithful daughter be handed over to him, but the Thaian king claimed he had no knowledge of their whereabouts. So the trace of the traitorous daughter was lost."

This would mean, of course, that we would have to create some spells to obtain information by means of magic which is plain to see when you are close to the targeted person.

For now, however, we have stopped the research because we felt it is necessary to create the groundwork for future research in the field.

He even travelled to distant Drefia which in those days was at the zenith of its glory, and he met many necromancers who were willing to share their knowledge with him. This way he became even more powerful. Using stolen lifeforce he lived longer than any man was meant to live, and with his own eyes he saw the might of his necromancer allies decline. Legend has it that one day the djinn of good decided to stop the outrageous cabals of Drefia. Other stories say that it was in fact the evil djinn who saw their power threatened by it. Whatever the true cause might be, one night a star fell down from the sky and smashed most of Drefia, breaking its evil power forever, and the goldsmith finally met his fate. His most prized treasure, the lamp of Tazur was lost that night. It is said that it is still there somewhere, hidden on the ocean bed, waiting for a new owner."

        "text": "The lost garden\nPrincess Maharuh was said to be the kindest creature that ever walked the earth. She was dearly loved both by her people and by the djinns. One day as the princess wept because of all the pain and the evil ways of the world the djinns came to comfort her. And since they loved her so much they called upon their powers to grow a garden of magnificent beauty. From now on, Maharuh visited her enchanted garden whenever she was sad, and she never went there but a smile came to her face, and she found new strength to continue her work with renewed vigour and inspiration. But humans grow old and weary, and time did not fail to do its cruel work on fair Princess Maharuh. As she grew old her visits to the garden became less and less frequent and one day when she laid down to rest underneath her favourite tree she never woke up again. The garden was perhaps the most valuable thing she left behind, and it was certainly the one she had held dearest while still alive. But her people did not share her love for nature's beauty, and all they saw was a splendid example of horticulture that could be turned into money. Soon after her death a merchant caravan came, and the strangers offered great sums for the garden and for all that belonged to it. They dug out the trees and took the fruit because they believed they could rebuild the garden in their native land. However, soon after the caravan had left the city a terrible sandstorm arose. After the storm had cleared the caravan was gone and with it all that was left of the garden."

It is still too difficult to predict in what way the fabric of time and space is affected by the breach of the sphere, and from what we have seen the backlash of nature against demonic incursion can range from a slightly offensive odour to a sizeable explosion such as the one we saw yesterday. I am personally disappointed to observe that the elemental protection spells we put up did not work at all. Perhaps there is some truth in the reports that the unleashed energy is of purely entropical nature. We have yet to decide whether or not it makes sense to create an entropic counterspell first, but I support the idea that the loss of manpower while trying to balance the spell is manageable. It is possible, though, that this will lead to no convincing result at all due to the uncontrollable nature of the demonic realm. If this should be the case the use of entropic countermagic is the only option left.\nBy the way: The summoning of lesser creatures, the so-called 'reds', progressed comparatively well. Of course, these creatures are mere borderdwellers and may consequently not be considered true demons. However, it may prove that the development of summoning spells for 'reds' will prove a rewarding spin-off of demon summoning research."

The astral patterns wax and wane like the tides, and it is not possible to perform certain summonings on inappropriate days, to give but one example. The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual. The more mana is used in a spell the more it is susceptible to extratibian influence. For this reason it seems quite safe to assume that certain powerful rituals are only possible when the stars are correctly aligned. We consequently hope to achieve through close observation and through careful calculation a measure of exactness concerning the right timing of rituals which we did not dare dream of so far. Several magic incantations we have never managed to reproduce until now might actually be achieved once we know the ideal stellar constellations. This would explain why all our previous attempts to achieve these effects were doomed to fail."

Other, more complex rituals may only be performed at very specific times, perhaps even at a specific hour. Other rituals that are more complex still are bound to specific days, and to specific times as well. In fact, some individual spells can only be performed once a year or once every other year, while the most powerful of rituals may only be carried out during stellar constellations that are so incredibly rare that centuries may pass before the ritual can be performed again. Given the power and knowledge of the ancients it seems reasonable to assume that they have prepared rituals whose time has not even come to this very day. Since most of the ancient races have disappeared from the lands it is well possible that some of the rituals are still be buried in some long forgotten ruin, while others might actually be in the possession of some surviving heir of one of the ancient races.\nWho knows. The astrological knowledge of the ancients is yet to be rediscovered. We are perfectly positive that some of the discoveries we have made can be considered as the groundwork for further, more elaborate theories which one day might rival that of the ancients. Still, it would be an immense progress if we could rediscover some of the ancients' lost astrological writings."

Though most of these loners followed the path that the gods had planned for them, some lacking restraint and company became driven made by their loneliness. Crazed they defied the gods and banded together, accumulating an army of the mad and the lost. This army they lead onto a rampage through the battlefields of their days. They caused havoc and destruction on both sides but ultimately they were crushed and thought dead. But some of them survived, hidden at unholy places and feeding on them. In time they grew in power and when they arose again they were horrible to behold. Their rise fell into a time of relative peace, after the reawakening and those relics of war disdained what they saw. Where others saw harmony they saw weakness. Where others saw love, they saw a lack of ambition. They renewed their old bonds and looked for fallen allies of days long past. They reformed the legion, which was a mockery of the power of the past. Yet their madness, hatred and ambition drove them forward. They began to look for the guidable, the power-hungry and baited them with poisoned promises. They are still out there, scheming, manipulating, looking to increase their power in clear defiance of all gods."

Oddly enough it is quite simple to focus the spell into an object, preferably an amulet, so the change is still bound to an object that serves as a transmitter. Obviously the problem is related to the one we had when we tried to channel certain spells through runes. I'm afraid that while research covering spontaneous magic has made great advances since the early days we are still at the beginning when it comes to channelled spells."

This is the time when the Larokhons' move from their secret hideouts to prey on unwary dreamers that are haunted by nightmares. Their sense of smelling fear is infallible, and once they have found their prey a mere crack in a wall is large enough for them to enter. Once they are close to their victims they feast on their innermost fears, evoking images of horror and despair that are so horrible that they often cause the dreamer's death.

When he claimed the dragon slaying by a shepherd, who was assumed to have died in the fight, as his own, another knight confronted him with a wounded but alive shepherd and called his bluff. Rewar, seemingly infuriated, demanded a trial by combat, thinking that he would easily best a mere herder of sheep, unskilled in the use of arms.

He served as a sword for hire for some time, but serving did not suit him well and he abandoned his employers often in the time of greatest peril. Often he did so, with a good part of the employers wealth. Some he betrayed for gold, others out of spite. With his reputation ruined his traveling intensified. As an old man he returned to the realm and bought himself a pardon by a young, new king with his ill-gotten wealth.

The recent studies we have carried out together have proven that we can indeed learn from each other. I must admit I would certainly like to add this useful little spell to my personal repertoire. After all, shovels and pickaxes are heavy and pretty unwieldy, and I would very much like to leave them at home. I envy the priests for the elemental powers they are wielding."

It is strongly advisable to keep the substance in the casket. I opened it once and minutes later it swarmed with rotworms and carrion worms. Many of my people died in this accident. We presume that we deal with an attractant of a rotworm queen. No one has ever seen one but we are pretty sure that this species is organised by a queen. Maybe it would be possible to lure a queen with this substance but we don't dare to use it again. We need more time to figure out how this all matches and how to use the substance without being overrun by rotworms."

        "text": "The Astonishing Fairy Tale of the Little Piglet and the Isle of Evil\nOnce upon a time there was a little piglet named Ethan. But it was not an ordinary piglet but a piglet that wanted to become a detective. I, the cat Sandy, was his best friend ever and so we decided that his dream should become true. With our friends, Harry the owl and Monty the dog, we founded a detective agency. One day, while playing at the beach, we found some ominous footsteps in the sand. Ethan immediately knew that these were the footsteps of a criminal and we all decided to pursue the trail and catch the villain. After a while we reached a spot where the footsteps vanished in the sea. At first, me and my friends were clueless what to do, but then Harry's keen eyes spotted a harbour not that far away. By chance our old friend Wesley the weasel was working in the harbour and could provide us not only with a boat but also with some good advice. So we finally set sails and used Monty's amazing ability to follow a trail by scent to find our way across the sea. Eventually we reached an island that was thoroughly evil. It took all our courage and bravery to make our way through the dangerous territory to the dominating structure of the evil tower that loomed over the whole isle. We were well aware that the master of that tower had to be the epitome of evil and we had to enter his tower, regardless of the dangers involved. Only few had ever reached the isle and none of them had ever returned to tell the tale. But we were there and knew that it was our destiny to face the master of the isle. Retreat was not an option. We braved all the dangers that the isle seemed to throw against us and finally stood in front of the tower. Who would carry on our work if we failed? We knew if we did not stop the master of this isle then it might take decades until somebody else would find this isle, and then it might be too late to stop the fiendish plot that threatened the whole world. So we made it to the top of the tower and confronted its evil master! To our surprise it was no one else than our old rival Melvin the mouse! He switched on the lights which blinded Harry, threw a stick that Monty was forced to pursue, and then, to my shame, confronted me with a ball of yarn so huge I could not resist but had to play with it. But just as Melvin the mouse laughed evilly, Ethan, with an incredibly effort of will, ignored the mud the cunning mouse had just prepared to distract him and captured the culprit. With Melvin being caught, we others regained our composure and senses and returned to out little ship. We handed Melvin over to his mother and he was not allowed to eat any sweets for two weeks. This is the end of my little story about the isle of evil."

        "text": "The art of war by Brianna Bonecrusher\nTo win a war, or even a fight, one has to discard certain ideals of nobility and honour. While honour is a noble concept it is less noble to let your soldiers die because you follow some lofty goal. As a leader it is your foremost duty to ensure that as many of your soldiers as possible return home, unharmed, in tact and preferably victorious. This can't be done by open battles that follow some sort of code. Battles have certain dynamics that makes any code obsolete after the initial clash anyway. Therefore, the surest tactic for success is to weaken the enemy as much as possible before you even think about engaging them in battle at all. A hit and run tactic is a wonderful strategy for achieving this aim. This requires the army to operate in small groups, making the maximum use of the terrain, traps and distance weapons. Let the environment cause as much harm as possible. Force your enemy to seek its way through treacherous countryside, lure them into the lairs of animals and monsters and don't give them the chance to restock supplies. Don't grant them the comfort of an undisturbed rest. Harass and attack them constantly from afar so they never feel safe. Bleed them out and wear them down and don't let them retreat to safety because then they might return, and be better prepared as they are wise to the guerilla tactics you use. The main goal is always to keep your own casualties low. If the enemy has no or little distance attacks you might be able to pick many of his soldiers off without any meaningful retaliation. Let your distance fighters aim for key figures first whenever possible. If you face enemies with numerous distance fighters attack them under cover of night using your own shooters spread out wide and roughly aiming for the enemy's camp. When forced to fight in close quarters, use an ambush strategy whenever possible. If possible, be prepared for a hasty retreat when things turn out nasty. She who fights and runs away will live to fight another day."

Not only did the man write unceasingly himself, he was also capable of dictating three books to scribes at the same time. He rested only to sleep and eat, and that infrequently. His Editor in Chief had the idea of turning to the sorcerer Eclesius to create a Scribe Golem to keep up with the stream of literature. Eclesius found the idea wonderful (and the monetary reward was probably not too unwelcome either) After many false starts and several fatal accidents (not for Eclesius or the Editor, obviously) the Scribe Golem was completed. Not only was this Golem capable of editing and writing down Arnadette's work at the same pace as the author, it was also capable of banding the books, leaving the editorial team with little more to do than distribute the end product to various libraries. (Eclesius also installed some improvements - for instance, pages in Tibian books no longer needed to be turned, the reader simply had to scroll down the text to read what was written, as Eclesius believed page turning to be a waste of energy and an interruption to the flow of a good book.) While this meant that Arnadette's works could finally be recorded without a backlog building up, Arnadette himself began to suffer. Whenever he wished to break to sleep, eat, or anything else, the Golem would go on the rampage screaming \"More Books! More Books!\" and start destroying the interior furnishings. Eventually, the editorial team left one by one, unable to help Arnadette, and in fear of their lives should he ever cease to produce literature leading to the Golem going fully out of control. Eclesius was also strangely uncontactable. The Editor in Chief stuck with his old master as long as he could, but even he, in his old age was forced to abandon him.\nThe libraries are still being filled by his books - so which version is true? A man held in thrall by a Golem, forced to write day and night without break for sleep nor rest or are unscrupulous want-to-be writers attempting to make a quick buck off the back of a literary legend? This book is a plea for help! For your childhood memories of good books, the brave adventurers who read this book, please find out whatever became of Leetha Arnadette!"

        "text": "Whatever became of Leetha Arnadette?  Volume 1\nThere is not a Tibian who does not know of Leetha Arnadette, Tibia's most prolific author. He has written books in almost every genre, from horror to history, fact to fiction, children's bedtime stories to university textbooks. Which pupil has not groaned inwardly when told to learn by heart passages from Arnadette's \"Tibia - A History\" (Or even outwardly groand - an action that cost this humble author three days off school with concussion - how was I to know my teacher was a high ranking paladin and the champion of the Rat Hurling Guild and a deadly shot with a board rubber?) Which babe has not been lulled into sweet dreams by Arnadette's \"Nighttime tales for tiny Tibian tots\"? Who has not wished to be Gerrick, the hero of \"Jungle Adventure\", and which adolescent has not been terrified by the story of the \"Northwood Wolves\"? No tourist in his right mind would consider travelling without Arnadette's \"Rough Guide to Tibia\" and even some households would be poorer for the lack of \"Tibian Cooking Today, 1001 ways to serve Fish.\"\nMany have wondered exactly where he got his inspiration from. His writings cover such a wide range of topics to such depth of expertise, that in his former years he must have been a great explorer and a well read student. However, there are no records of him ever having studied at any academy in Tibia and even grandparent's grandparents talk of him as an old man - which has led to the rumour that elven blood runs in his veins. Those who used to see him on his monthly trips out to the shops in his home town reported that he would often stop dead in his tracks, emit sparks from his beard, then grab a notebook from his robes and scribble frantically. Indeed there is one story that stated that he took three days to make it down the street, and citizens of Carlin took pity on his scribbling form and made sure he had food and drink. It is these rare sightings of Arnadette that led many to believe that he was either blessed (or cursed) with Godly inspiration, that he had been selected by the Gods as their scribe. In a world with so many Gods, this is an unfortunate fate for one man to bear, and also leads to the interesting question of exactly which God was responsible for the book titled \"Why Rabbits Should be Blown up on Sight\".\nArnadette has not been seen for many years, although he continues to produce books with incredible speed. Rumours had begun to circulate that he was actually dead and other writer's were selling books under his name simply to earn money. However, an old man, apparently his editor, has spoken out, claiming to know the truth about his sad fate. Whether the following fantastic tale is a true confession or the ramblings of a senile man remains to be seen, but it is the author's belief that this story should be brought to the attention of the public, so people braver than I may try to save Arnadette from a fate worse than ... well ... a bad fate."

        "text": "Tibiantis\nSomewhere to the South of the city which nowadays is known as Carlin, could once be found an isle, believed to be the cradle of human civilisation. Here, the first Tibians saw the light of the two suns and founded the first Kingdom. It grew to be a place of wisdom and wonder. Under the guidance of the Gods, humanity prospered in terms of wealth and knowledge to heights that no other civilisation has reached before or since. This city was called Tibiantis, and it grew beyond the bounderies of the land, spreading into the sea itself. Wonder upon wonder could be found in this city of ivory and gold. Explorers from Tibiantis braved the oceans and built outposts in the farthest reaches of the world. It is said of the denizens of this wonderful city that the elements themselves were at their beck and call and that no foe was strong enough to oppose them. However, they grew complacent and self satisfied, forgetting that everything they were and everything they had built up had been done only because they were favoured of the Gods. Eventually, they forgot their Gods, believing instead that they were the masters of the world. The Gods were saddened as they watched those who had made them so proud turn their backs upon them, and turned their eyes from them. Without the protection of the Gods, the city of Tibiantis was doomed. Its wealth and arrogance made it an irresistable target for the forces of evil. Their day of reckoning came - the Isle was sunk, the beautiful sculptured architecture of the towers of ivory and gold crumbled and the citizens drowned, the achievements and inventions of the civilisation lost forever beneath the waves.\nOnly the highest tip of the highest mountain of the isle remained as a tiny island, a pitiful memory of the greatness that once existed here. Legends state that this isle cannot be reached by normal means. The versions of the legend vary - some claim the isle is inhabited by diabolic creatures ensuring Tibiantis may never rise again and others state that benevolent messengers of the Gods live there and mourn for the lost children and warn others of the fate that threatens those who forget their Gods. The city itself rests on the lowest point of the ocean floor, and those inhabitants who were unfortunate to survive were twisted into abominal sea creatures. The colonies and outposts of Tibiantis did not survive the downfall of their home for long. They fell prey to the numerous enemies their people had made and who no longer feared retaliation. Only a few of their inhabitants survived to found new cities in remote places. Though they forgot their heritage they finally grew in numbers and created new cities and kingdoms, some of which still thrive in the present day."

        "text": "The Northwood Wolves\nThe woods north of Carlin were home to numerous wild beasts. Packs of wolves were only one part of the fearsome fauna inhabiting the forests. So when sheep and cattle disappeared, no-one paid too much attention. Hunters were sent and they killed some of the wolves, however, the numbers of livestock stolen did not reduce. However, it was when humans fell victims to the wolf attacks that people turned to the Queen for aid. The conclave of druids, however, intervened and prevented the people from hunting down and killing every last wolf. They promised to take care of the problem themselves. Four of their most knowledgable beastlords were charged with the task of ending the threat. Only one returned, wide-eyed with fear and unable to speak coherently of what he had seen. And now, the true reign of terror began - whole farmsteads were attacked and their inhabitants torn apart and devoured. The druids organised a force of hunters and spellcasters. They fought their way through the woods, facing packs of wolves who seemed to be fighting as organised forces with an almost human intelligence. Despite winning the battle they failed to win the war and the ultimate source of the evil controlling the wolves, and more people fell victim to the wolves' attacks. The following winter a blood smeared adolescent was found, wandering aimlessly through the woods. His name was Charles Farmer. Shaking and half mad, those who found him were able to piece together his confession. He claimed he had killed his mother with a silver candelebra to make the wolf in her stop doing evil things. The boy was given over to the care of the druids, who took him in and protected him and the community from his madness. After this incident, the attacks on the farms and killings in Northwood ceased from one day to the next."

His oppressive and pious upbringing suited him well and from early age he joined an order of knights, dedicated to erase anything they deemed heretic. It was not much a choice of heart but the only sanctioned opportunity to escape the control of his overbearing father. The knights run several campaigns against the orcs and minotaurs mostly. Picking easy targets they were met with little resistance and the already very loose organisation of the order begun to dissipate more and more with the members often following their own petty agendas. Krule lead several raids against renegade orcs and later human bandits. His claiming of the loot did not suit the victims of the robbers well so as an empty gesture towards them, Krule disposed captured criminals in a rather gruesome fashion, claiming his campaigns were rather aimed at discouraging other criminals, then reclaiming stolen goods. With a growing strength and order in the kingdom, his targets became less and less and so he begun campaigns far from the borders to strike any easy target that seemed suitable. Under the pretence of doing the god's work, he begun to plunder ancient ritual sites and burial grounds of what he deemed heathens. Over time he and his war band had degraded into little more than bandits and grave robbers. Although operating far from the realm and not facing imminent threats, his acts of cruelty continued. It's not known if these vile acts lead to some shaman to curse him or if he was cursed in some ancient tomb which treasures he stole. But it's safe to say that his later years were spent in campaigns of slaughter and fire to acquire the means to end at least some form of curse. The nature of the curse could never truly be determined as he and all who accompanied him were slaughtered by an orcish warlord and his army in an ambush. Some brethren of his order later reclaimed his remains and despite his deeds and reputation gave him a proper burial."

Befriending the citizens is not done easily. Trading with them can often be tiresome and even dangerous when looking at their temper in combination with alcohol. All in all, one could assume that Svargrond is rather an unlikely ally for our respectable Carlin but for strategical and economical reasons it is quite the contrary. Svargrond is one of the cities easily accessible by us that is not under the sway of Thais in some form. A dominance of Thais in Svargrond could severely hamper our seafaring and trade.\nThe harsh environment of the northern isles makes Svargrond an interesting trading partner from an economical point of view. Many of our goods cannot be created by themselves or would be extremely expensive if they were produced with their own resources. Although the mining operations have not really been running again yet, there is still an abundance of resources that we can trade for our goods as soon as Svargrond's economy has developed somewhat more. For now, we mainly trade amber, ivory, bones, furs, and meat. Later, we hope to be able to trade for ores, gemstones and even shaman-made potions and elixirs. Sadly the cultural differences still pose a severe problem for our trades or the expansion of our post here. Although our fighters gained some respect, the prominence of alcohol in that culture is a constant thorn in our side. Officially it has been declared not to make an issue of this difference, but sometimes this is easier said than done when facing some threatening drunkard. So against earlier plans, we maintain only a minor presence in Svargrond. This tactic seems to work well as he barbarians are not fond of intrusions in their everyday lives. Unfortunately, their constant war with their even less civilized brethren in the south hampers our ambitions to get a hold on the resources of the isles. On the other hand, it makes our wares even more valuable for the besieged people of Svargrond."

        "text": "The close relationship with Carlin has served the druids quite well over the years. In Thais, the druids had only a minor role which was always overshadowed by the sorcerer guild and its close ties to the Thaian throne. In Carlin, however, the druids were seen as trusted advisers for the young city. This early cooperation led to the growth of Carlin in a more harmonic and environmental way than any other city. Right from the beginning, druids instructed the people of Carlin in the ways of nature and watched over the city's development. Moreover, there was a constant demand for the druids' help which resulted in the use of druidic powers in some practical ways that were never thought of before. Additionally, the need of the people led to experiments to expand the druidic powers in new ways. This lead to some significant progress of the druids' magic. Although critics call this approach too practical and too less metaphysical, it is undeniable that new magical practices arose in those days that shaped the druidic research significantly. With additional resources and freedom, the druidic art flourished along with the city, and the teachings of the druids reached more people now that they were always present and no longer hid in some distant caves. The dynamic aspect of the process helped both sides and led to a new boom in druidic magic.\nNow that some contact with Svargrond was established, there are even new chances to reintegrate what many see as early offshoots of druidism developed through contact with shamans. Even though it is a painfully slow process to leave behind prejudices and cultural differences, it is widely accepted that both traditions can learn from each other. The combination of two branches of the same magical teaching that took different paths for centuries might lead to new and unknown heights of druidism that might even herald in a new age of magic."

In the past, the elves' acceptance of Carlin was founded on the fact that one of them was likely to be the next victim of another orc invasion. With Carlin's strength growing, the elves' opinion began to shift. Some even saw a threat in Carlin's growth, however, most agreed that in the case of an orcish threat both cities forces combined might be able to stop the green flood now. Still, there was only minor trade between Carlin and Ab'Dendriel since both cities strived for independence. Only when the orcish threat decreased and an invasion became unlikely, the trade began to flourish somewhat. Still, the alien culture of the elves makes it hard to have any meaningful negotiations. Particularly the complicated caste system with different leaders makes it very difficult to come to some kind of agreement that would please everyone."

        "text": "The Amazons Vol.3\nThis background of political conflict led to the ascendance of Amaza Saphira, an alchemist with an unusual talent for inspirational speeches and leadership. She claimed to have had visions of Banor and Elaine, informing her of the natural superiority of womankind. Although her political opponents attempted to discredit her, calling her delusional and stating that her visions were the results of noxious fumes concocted in her laboratory, Amaza'S speeches spoke to many people, and her radical viewpoint inspired many to join her cause. It was her belief that men were inferior beings and that Carlin was an acomplishment of womanhood. She wanted to drive all men from the city, or keep them in subjugation serving only in menial positions. She wanted to expand the army to demonstrate the strength of womanhood. Though she gained many followers, her radical position served as an example of the dangers of extremism and finally, the Queen felt pushed into a more moderate way of handling the army and its leadership.\nAmaza, however, was not content with the Queen's decision and continued to gather followers amongst the population, many of them in the Queen's own army. What Amaza possessed in charisma and oratory she lacked in subtlety and secrecy. So her plan to overthrow the Queen and become a warrior queen in her place was doomed to failure before it could even begin. Although parts of the army sympathized with her ideas, not all were convinced enough to abandon their duty and betray their oaths to their Queen. Amaza and several of her key-followers were jailed before they could make their move. In the night before their trial Amaza and her allies were freed by some of her remaining followers in the city guard and their escape turned bloody when forces loyal to the Queen intervened.\nHowever, Amaza and her women managed to escape the city. She now turned to the families who lived in the woods and the women who had abandoned the city after the army had been disbanded in search for new followers. These families had, over the years, taken on the structure of nomadic tribes and carried a strong warrior heritage which made them susceptible to Amaza's teachings. Many of the tribeswomen joined Amaza's forces, and over the weeks and months of her exile further recruits from Carlin arrived.\nPerhaps, given time, Amaza might have eventually led her forces against Carlin. Perhaps with the help of conspirators within the city her forces might have surprised and overcome the Queen's army. However fate had a different end in store for her. She was killed by an orcish arrow in a night ambush. Even today, there is some speculation as to whether this conveniant solution to Carlin's problems was truly an act of fate, or whether the Queen had a hand in Amaza's death. Other theories state that the Thaian King was more concerned about Amaza's cult threatening the status quo in his city than he was happy about the destabilizing effect it was having on Carlin. A final explanation is that the Druid COuncil itself was responsible for her demise. However, there is precious little proof that the orcish arrow was anything more than an unfortunate series of events that in the long run probably prevented a long, drawn out struggle for the people of Carlin.\nHer remaining followers named themselves Amazons in her honour. Though some of them returned to the city, most were too proud for such a move and stayed in the woods. Over the years outcasts from Carlin and desperate or vengeful women joined their ranks. So even when the original group splintered, the several subgroups and tribes managed to survive. Over the years they adopted various codes which can be more or less related to Amaza'S teachings. Those teachings have been passed on by word of mouth and are based on the rather unspecific speeches Amaza made. How much of the current practises of the Amazons is still based on the spirit of their founder is debatable."

The core of the army was formed by the scouts and a city guard. This army was to be reinforced by a highly trained militia in times of need. Through many years, this militia became an effective force, so effective in fact, that as its reputation spread, those soldiers of fortune who may have been tempted to attack a city run by women decided they would be better off seeking their wealth elsewhere. Thus, the need for an army declined, and the cost of maintaining a standing army became too much of a burden for a city which was striving to become a major force in trading.\nThe army was therefore disbanded, and it was expected of the women that they return to their former occupations. This did not please many of them, who felt that they were being cast off and neglected and accused the Queen and her advisors of being short sighted and ignorant of the dangers to their city. When they failed to find support from the Queen they abandoned the city, setting up outposts in the woods to protect the militant way of life to which they had become accustomed.\nSeveral years had passed after the death of Bella Bonecrusher, the valiant warrior who had roused the womenfolk of Carlin to protect themselves against the orcs, when the future direction of the army became a focal point for political conflict within the court of Carlin. Several conflicting groups jostled to influence the Queen in order to follow their own agendas, attempting to manipulate the army, its size, its composition and its aims for the furtherance of their own interests."

        "text": "The Amazons Vol.1\nWhen Carlin was freed from the shackles of Thaian oppression, the imminent threat of attempts to recapture the city loomed over the weary populace. Some families left the city to hide in the woods. Those who remained immediately began with the construction of fortifications. With the assistance of druids and helpful elves some of the younger women were trained as scouts and roamed the surrounding woods to warn the city in the case of an advancing army.\nHowever, it was at this time unknown to the people of Carlin that Thais was no longer in a position to launch another campaign to recapture the city. With the destruction of its biggest and best legion, the threat of rebellion loomed within the city's walls and advancing monsters at its borders were more than the remaining forces could handle. Still, Thais held on to its claim to the Carlinian lands and tried to incite mercenary bands with bounties to move against Carlin. Unfortunately for Thais, the lawlessness that had overtaken the countryside as a direct result of the conflict between the cities meant that the mercenaries found much more lucrative employment protecting merchant caravans and the homes of wealthy Tibians who chose to live outside the safety of the cities. Further, there was much speculation that the coffers of the Thaian King had been drained in the struggle with Carlin, and the mercenaries severely doubted Thais ability to pay up. However, there were still those mercenaries desperate enough for money, who were unable to find employment protecting trade caravans because their reputations as bandits rather than mercenaries preceded them. This motley bunch readily believed the stories about a defenceless city of weak women whose menfolk had been massacred by raiding orcs. However, these bands of so-called mercenaries were unable to organise themselves into a larger group. Unwilling to share the rewards from such easy pickings, the bands of mercenaries travelling to the North fought each other whenever they met.\nAt the same time as the mercenary bands were fighting each other on their way to the North, the scouts of Carlin encountered the remnants of the orcish invasion force that still roamed the woods. More often than not, the badly organised bands of orcs would be put to the sword and arrow and killed by the scouts. However, the orcs soon grew wise to these attacks and formed themselves into a larger group, posing a significant threat too large to be dealt with by the scouting parties alone.\nIt was Bella Bonecrusher, a young warrior, who saw the potential of the threat and, in a rousing speech, stirred the remaining women of the city to join with the scouts and fight the menace posed by the growing organisation of the orcs. Emissaries were sent to the Elves at Ab'Dendriel to alarm them of the danger that the orcs also posed to their borders. While diplomatic discussions were underway, the newly recruited warriors were armed with equipment salvaged from the battlefields and were hastily trained by the scouts. When the Elven reinforcements arrived in Carlin they were greeted by a ragtag army of untried women. Despite their lack of experience in the battlefield, this army faced the orcs and won against the odds. Soon, the woods were cleared of orcs. Bella Bonecrusher argued that in these troubled times a standing army would be a necessity, others pointed out that everyone was needed to rebuild the city and work on the fields. The discussions turned moot when the scouts reported the advancing war bands of mercenaries from the south. The new army was sent to intercept the advancing forces. The mercenaries, separated in several groups, never high in morale and heavily outnumbered were soundly defeated by the Carlinian forces whose losses were negligible, thanks to the healing magic of the druids."

        "text": "Behind The Veil Of Ignorance I\nZathroth's shrouded hoard of forbidden knowledge is known by many names in many cultures.\nParts of this hoard of ancient knowledge were compiled by races long gone and creatures that were not meant to exist. Other parts manifested on their own by means so unfathomable, only some book hidden away in that library might tell about.\nMost of what is known about it comes from the scriptures of Zathroth of which many were destroyed in the great purge of the first Inquisition. Other information was gathered from sealed notes the inquisition took in their interrogations. Yet some parts of the compiled information was gained by whisperers in the dark that claimed to be on a mission of enlightenment. Most of what is complied here is old, fractured and incomplete - yet the best available by our means and efforts which were both substantial.\nIt is said that much of the hoard's knowledge was gained by divine insights of Zathroth. Some might just be the ramblings of madmen but still contain disturbing insights. Other parts are even more obscure and can't be reasonably associated with any kind of writer at all.\nMost texts are said to hold the secrets of acquiring more arcane power for oneself - yet to a terrible price. But to the people who ventured that far into the territory of dark knowledge, these prices seem trivial at best.\nSome of the knowledge centers on summoning forth unspeakable things from beyond the known worlds, out of abysses of darkness and madness. Others are supposed to bend elements, space, minds and souls to the will of the user.\nThe accumulated knowledge is immense and twisted to condense and enrich it even more in a way that words can't truly contain it any longer.\nMost books are encrusted with wards and sigils that try to contain as much of the knowledge as possible bound to the volume.\nThe knowledge is still so powerful and potent that it often gained a form of will on its own and maliciously preyed on the minds of the unwary. This knowledge acts like a parasite, draining its bearers soul and mind, whispering misleading and tainted lies, drawing them deeper onto forbidden paths.\nSecrets thought long lost and deceptively easy answers to tantalising questions are bound to lead scholars and mystics alike to treachery and the denouncement of all gods but Zathroth.\nIt is said the hoard is located at a place that 'one time might be' and that 'it is lost to the forever'. It is shrouded by magic, arcane wards, deceptions and ignorance. The key is said to be a state of mind and the lock is ready to break any key that is not strong enough to unlock it."

        "text": "Tibiantis: Fact and Fiction\nIn the light of progress made my modern science the tales of Tibiantis can be cheerfully disregarded as blatant myths. The author of this questionable history merely drew upon several myths and mixed them together to create a tale plausible to those given to believe such romantic nonsense. The recently discovered, or more accurately, recently rediscovered, city of Yalahar is very obviously a major inspiration for the story of Tibiantis. Aspects of the story can be found in actual fact in Yalahar - the city itself is huge, and also extended its borders beyond the land into the sea, and judging from what can be found there, was most definitely at some point in its past a city that was home to great wonders, whose inhabitants were in possession of great knowledge. However, one of the great mysteries of Yalahar is whether in actual fact those that live there are even human or another race, until recently unknown amongst the Tibian civilisations. The aspect of the story of Tibiantis referring to the downfall of a civilisation could be influenced by many different myths. One such source could be based upon the discoveries made far to the North of Tibia which suggest the possibility of a civilisation that was wiped out by an as yet unknown catastrophe of cataclysmic proportions. Equally, to the extreme south of Tibia can be found the Shattered Isles. These Isles were so named with good reason - geological studies conducted by the Explorers' Society reveal that these isles did not so much sink but were blasted by a phenomenal explosion of some kind. Relics found upon the Isles also hint that they were once populated by a great and most likely advanced civilisation. It is the sad fate of these isles to be the home of the infamous Quara. It is these twisted creatures who probably provide the origin of the myth's fish people. In summary, I believe I have gathered enough proof here to dispell any reason for believing the tale of Tibiantis, and have proven it to be nothing but a conglomeration of ancient stories and legends which an overly ambitious and half informed so-called historian has put together into a new myth of his own making, in order to gain cheap fame by hoodwinking a gullible and uninformed public."

They were able to retrieve Brian, more dead than alive from the waves. Over the next few days, it became clear that Brian's brush with the lightning had not left him unchanged. His hair was completely statically charged and reacted to any contact with metal with violent sparks of lightning, and any contact with others led to them getting slight electric shocks. Brian reacted rather stoically and refrained from shaving his beard and cutting his hair. The static charge meant that his hair attracted dust - thus giving him the nickname of Dustbeard. When Jolly Jack went into retirement, Dustbeard's characteristic appearance, his golden tongue, his skills as a seaman and liberal amounts of homebrewed alcohol led him to be the natural choice of the crew as captain.\nUpon becoming captain he remembered his old grudge towards his hometown and began to harass the coastal towns of Carlin. When Carlin re-established contact to the town of Svargrond, Dustbeard was there to threaten the new shipping lines. Dustbeard and his men might not be the most skilled pirates but they are known to attack ships against all odds when they are drunk enough. Their unpredictability in battle often gives them the element of surprise, and often their victims are so astonished at the sight of the drunken pirates with their manically haired Captain, that Dustbeard's men more often than not meet with success. It is only a question of time though, before this kind of behaviour will lead to their demise."

        "text": "Biographies of the Rich and Infamous\nDustbeard the Pirate Vol. 1\nThis is the sensational story behind one of our most notorious pirates, whose hairstyle has sparked a veritable fashion amongst the more rebellious Tibian nobility! It is the story of (who else could it be?) Dustbeard, the infamous and follicly advantaged Pirate! Dustbeard was born under the unassuming name of Brian Eagleston in the City of Carlin. Even in his youth he made a name for himself with the town's authorities, getting involved in brawls in taverns and vandalising public property. He was among the first to be banned from Karl's pub in Carlin. Before he could even grow the beard that was to become his trademark he was involved in the illegal production and trade of alcohol. After some of his customers suffered severe illnesses (hallucinations, memory loss, blindness) he was arrested and sentenced to forced labour in the woods and docks. It was in this milieu that he reinvented himself as a political activist and freedom fighter, demonstrating the skills in leadership and oratory that were to serve him so well in his later career. He convinced his inmates that his trade in alcohol was in fact a form of rebellion. He was not even 20 years of age when he led his fellow prisoners in a revolt in which they captured the ship they had just helped to build and set sail for Thais. Unfortunately, none of his followers were proficient in sailing or navigation, and his first outing as a pirate was doomed to end in failure. The ship was wrecked on a reef while they were trying to reach a village to pilfer food and water. However, he and his men made it to the shore, where they proceeded to relieve the terrified villagers of their food, while faithfully promising that they would be repaid for the loss in due course in the name of the Thaian King. This procedure turned commonplace - he and his crew roamed the wilderness, harassing towns, knowing full well that this questionable course would provoke and bring them into conflict with the authorities, should they ever show up in Thais.\nHowever, this career of pillaging villages and coastal towns was fated to meet an end when he attempted to capture the cargo of a trade ship docked in the harbour of a sleepy coastal town. The Pirate Jolly Jack and his men had beaten them to the town and in the ensuing battle the majority of Brian's men were killed or fled, and Brian, a survivor as always, surrendered. The survivors were given the choice to join Jolly Jack's crew or be left to face the fury of the townsfolk. Of course, Brian and his remaining men chose to join the pirates. The following years saw Brian bloom into a capable seaman and pirate. His popularity amongst his pirate brethren was assured by his skill in brewing alcohol from anything and everything which he could get his hands on. However, it was his brewing skills that once again get him into trouble. A storm struck the ship after a night of particularly heavy drinking from a particularly heavy brew - half of the crew was unconscious and the other half were feeding the fishes. It was on this evening that an air elemental chose to attack the ship. It focused its attacks upon the sails of the ship, hoping to break the mast and drown the drunken sailors. Brian, more drunk than sober, climbed the mast and challenged the elemental fiend. Although it is unlikely that the elemental understood the curses and insults hurled at it by the drunken Brian, it was angered enough to attack him. It left off trying to drown the crew, and focussed instead upon the hapless Brian. It grabbed him and carried him high up into the air, where they were struck by lightning."

It is also well known that, as the years have proceeded, and Carlin has gone from strength to strength that Thaian claims on Carlin's territory have become nominal, at best. Although the Thaian Royal line and the Thaian nobility are linked with some of the bloodlines of Carlinian families, the times of open hostilities are part of the past, to the benefit of both cities. The only reason that Thais has not discarded its claims on Carlin is merely that such a move on behalf of the royal house would be viewed as weakness.\nBut, I hear you ask, if this is so, why are we still suffering under unfair trade barriers? Why does Thais still use its not inconsiderable political power to hinder Carlin's growth and prosperity?\nThe answer, my fellow Carlinians and concerned merchants, lies in Venore. Reliable sources who do not wish to be named for obvious reasons, who have contact with the highest officials of Thais, have revealed that the Thaian manouvering to infringe our rights and growth originates with the Trade Barons of Venore. The profit motivated Venoreans use their influence, propaganda and wealth to influence decisions made in Thais to the detriment of their greatest competitor - Carlin. Venorean agents are known to hinder Carlin's expansion through any means possible, be it bribery, threats, lies, blackmail or intrigue. Although this maouvering has mainly been covert, the success they have met with is making them more brash and confident and their intrigues are becoming more open and apparent. There is little doubt that they would go to any length to harm us. In fact, Venore is like a spider, waiting to pounce on us should we show any sign of weakness! However, Venore is still too cunning or too cowardly to act openly against our city. Theirs is not the way of open and honourable confrontation, rather, they prefer to let others do their dirty work for them. Thais is merely a tool for them to achieve their devious aims, while we, my friends, concentrate our suspicions upon Thais. By so doing, we are playing directly into their hands!\nThais may still pose the actual threat, but they are not the source of the evil. Should any of you still doubt the truth of my words, then the final, irrefutable proof of the Venorean Trade Barons'ambitions can be seen in the fact that they intentionally undercut our prices, ban our wares from the markets they control and they are the key agents for smuggling contraband into our city, undermining our profit margins and aiding the growth of the black market. It can be assumed that Carlins Girls' Brigade (CGB) has gathered files about Venorean activities and it is a shame that such information is not made public.\nNext issue: The CGB - Has it been Infiltrated?"

        "text": "Marcia Rugby's travels in the north\nMarcia Rugby was the youngest of three daughters of a Trading house in Carlin. Her family was heavily involved in the establishment of a trading outpost at Svargrond before the years of the plague of sea serpents. Marcia was entrusted with the tiresome negotiations with the barbarians of the north. To gain their trust she had to pass the infamous barbarian rite of passage and lived with the shamans on the Isle of Okolnir. Her determination, her iron will and her willingness to adapt and learn their culture duly impressed the barbarians. It was during the time that she spent with the shamans that a growing threat raised its ugly head - the threat of the sea serpents. Although messengers sent by her anxious family reached her in time, informing her that the last ships were about to leave for Carlin, she made the fateful decision to stay with the shamans, in accordance with her agreement with them.\nUpon her return to Svargond the majority of the people from Carlin had left, unwilling to risk getting stranded away from their homes and families. It was apparent that the sea serpents were not a passing threat. Marcia, however, was the daughter of a Trading House, and not one to sit around and wait for fortune to turn. She took her fate into her own hands and continued with her family's aim of setting up the trading outpost, ready for when the sea routes would become safe for ships once more. In order to make her venture a success she decided to explore the icy lands to find out more about the natural resources to be found there and what goods could be traded with the natives. She ventured far and wide, amassing a great deal of knowledge. However, it was during one of her more ambitious forays into the wilderness that she was captured by barbarian raider tribes. Her fluent use of the native tongue which belied her foreign appearance amazed her captors and she managed to negotiate to meet their leader. She was taken before one of the tribe's ice witches. Once more, her considerable skills in negotiation enabled her to convince the witch that she had to see the high ice witch Yakchal herself.\nMarcia so fascinated Yakchal with her stories from different lands and their wonders that she kept her interested enough to not be killed. She even managed to gain her trust enough to live in relative luxury in her captivity. Although it is unclear exactly how many years Marcia was in captivity, she was there long enough for the sea serpents to have been driven from the waters around Svargond. Rumours of the reopening of the trade channels reached Marcia, even in the isolated camp where she was held. In order to escape, she disguised herself as an ice witch and left Yakchal's hideout without rousing suspicion. Her long internment in the camp and her contact with the barbarians had taught her the necessary skills for survival in that unforgiving wilderness and finally she reached Svargond. It was here that she was reunited with her sisters, who had given her up for dead. She left with them to Carlin, but, too long used to a life of travel, she was unable to settle for long before wanderlust overcame her.\nShe decided to set out on an expedition to the Shattered Isles - an expedition from which she never returned. Her family waited in vain for news of her and were left to speculate whether her ship had fallen prey to one of the vicious and sudden storms known to haunt that region, whether it had fallen foul of pirates or whether it had been the victim of a Quara attack. Although the rest of Carlin presumed Marcia dead, her sisters continued to light a candle in Marcia's room, in the hope that she would, one day, return."

His chivalrous exploits were the base of many modern fairy tales and three of the lections of the art of fighting still bear his name. All the more his fall from grace was more than tragic. It's a bitter and sad tale, recounted numerous times in different ways. Most of this tale still romanticise what has happened. Historical records thankfully give us a more precise picture. In one of his chivalric journeys he met a damsel of incredible beauty. Yet she was engaged to another, much older knight for political reasons. What exactly transpired is still disputed. Though the historical texts give us some plain fact. It cannot be ruled out that his love was indeed the result of a curse of a swamp witch coven. Azaram had certainly participated in several witch-hunts, albeit not in a more active way then his compatriots. It is still possible that he, as a prominent figure was chosen for a curse, to have a greater impact. Also it can't be ruled out, that the damsel in question had a more active and sinister role in the things that transpired. Though the stage play 'The poisoned love of noble Azaram' depicts her as an evil schemer there is little factual evidence to support that claim. Indeed though, she took an unusual road for her travel to her fiance and certainly not in a time that was suited to traveling. But the assumption she orchestrated the attack on her company and the timely rescue by Azaram seems a bit farfetched. For sure it's recorded that he accompanied her on her way from there on. What transpired on their trip together no historian can tell. When they arrived at the home of her fiance, Azaram stayed as honoured guest. When the wedding drew near he was more and more often found in a drunken stupor and susceptible to fits of rage. In the evening before the wedding, the groom took offence of his behaviour and scolded Azaram, reminding him of the knightly virtues. This lead to an outburst of Azaram in which he drew his weapon and swiftly slew his offender. Sobered up by the shock of his own action, he grabbed the maid and forced their way out of the castle, leaving several men at arms dead. The nightly chase lead them to the swamp. Perhaps he wasn't aware where he was riding or perhaps he hoped to lose the pursuers in the marsh under cover of darkness. When the hunters arrived they only saw a gnarled, armoured fist raising from the swamp. when they managed to retrieve the body, OOO was dead. The maid was nowhere to be found, supposedly resting in the swamp for eternity."

From the earliest days of the fledgling city, when the druids helped to provide food and shelter, to the days of prosperity and stability when they offered guidance and healing, they have been a constant in Carlin's history. Because the druids have been rewarded with great respect and considerable influence as a result of their engagement in the city and their decisive role in its success, many druids have moved to Carlin. This has had the consequence that over time, Carlin has become a centre of druidic magic and teaching.\nWhen the looming threat of the Ghostlands was discovered it was the local druids who helped to erect a barrier that warded off the undead and the ghostly inhabitants. The prominence of druidic magic in Carlin has led to somewhat restrained relations with the Sorcerers' Guild that has close ties to Thais as is evident by the funding of the Edron academy. Over the course of time the more rigid guild members of the Sorcerers' Guild withdrew from Carlin and were replaced by freelancers and freethinkers with only loose ties to the Thaian guild so that over the years a form of acceptance between the local guilds was formed. The druids continue to be part of the everyday life of Carlin and heavily influence the culture and philosophy there."

        "text": "Nargol the impaler was a disgraced knight of an unimportant noble family. Acts of cowardice and drunken violence had cost him any of the little reputation that his birth right and knighthood had given to him. In times of relative peace his attempts as a sellsword yielded too little money to sustain himself. When he had sunk so low as to have sold most of his family arms and armour he started working as a bruiser for local thugs. His fate turned once again, when he became the bodyguard of a spirit speaker. So he accompanied his employer to the court of king Zelos, who was strongly interested in speaking to the spirits from beyond. He was there when the king consulted the spirits with the help of the medium and witnessed some of the plans that took shape in such seances. Seizing the opportunity in a sober moment, he pledged his sword and service to the king, which the latter accepted. King Zelos had only a few loyal allies and some knight, up to anything the king might command, suited him well enough. Even to his own surprise Nargol proved quite effective and efficient in his new role. Soon he became the chief enforcer of Zelos, who soon would become known as the ghost king. For his faithful service to the king's cause, Nargol was awarded with the best weapons and armour available and even magic items found their way into his possession. With an iron fist and without mercy or remorse, Nargol carried out his king's will, in a mockery of true knighthood. The king liked that Nargol acquired a reputation of needless cruelty and violence. Even the threat of a visit of Nargol and his men brought villages and nobles back to the heel. In service of the ghost king the fallen knight took many injuries and was maimed several times. His king though had him stitched together again and again, sometimes replacing or 'enhancing' whole body parts with gruesome, magical substitutes. Over the years he became more and more a thing than a man. A walking magical construct of its own. In the end he seemed almost mindless. Fused with his armour and weapons. Inactive or lost in the dark abysses of his soul unless called to action. When the ghost king finally perished, Nargol simply stopped to 'function'. He was found standing motionless on his horse that strode into a small village. He was rather stored away at a secret place then properly buried, because it was feared he might rise again."

Sometimes in his travels, while he already was a well-known and established knight, he acquired the secret of eternal youth. It is said that it was granted to him as a wish by fairies whom he had helped. Some whisper he had to sacrifice his own heart to acquire this gift. At least all sources agree that he was a changed man in his later live. While friends of old one by one retired and died, loved ones came and went, he grew more and more bitter and jaded. While he perfected his knightly arts more and more over the decades that passed, his views on knightly virtues became cynical at best. He sought out more and more perilous challenges, as they say out of a death wish. Regardless what fighter or menace he challenged, he went out victorious. He begun to let the more promising opponents live, albeit scarred and disfigured by his hand. It was assumed that this was his way to groom new challengers, to endanger his own live to at least sometimes feel some form of thrill. He antagonized the mighty and had only spite for the just and religious. Yet no challenger could match his skills. He fathered many children over the years and raised them with an iron fist, putting them through rigorous trainings and humiliation. That way he was fostering new generations of opponents that might be worthy one day to give him a challenge at last. At last it was his halve-elven daughter that would be his downfall. While she was a promising fighter he mistreated her like he always did with his children. When she dared to question his attitude once he had her mouth stitched shut. When he held a dashing young adventurer captive in his hold, she rescued him and the two fled. Vlarkorth followed them dispassionately. The hunt was just a mild thrill for him but better than nothing. So he chased them from one end of the world to another. Over the course of their adventures the fleeing pair made new friends and gathered a party of merry men and women. Sometimes Vlarkorth caught up but his prey eluded him in the end, albeit not without casualties. At some point the couple decided they could not run any longer. Alongside their allies they made a last stand and faced the heartless Vlarkorth. In a fierce battle one by one of their companions were wounded or killed. In the end only the halve-even maid and her lover stood against the barely wounded Vlarkorth. It was apparent that they both were no match for the ancient knight. As he was about to kill his daughter, the adventurer impaled himself on Vlarkorth 's weapon and weightened it down. The women, using her refined reflexes to honour his sacrifice, dispatched her ruthless father with a swift blow once and for all. Vlarkorth was buried in shame at a remote place."

This ensures trade with all cities, cultures and lands, known or yet to be discovered. Often seen as a separate law but actually part of the free trade agreement is the gambling licence, that is unique in the Thaian Kingdom, because 'commercial' gambling is outlawed since the times of king Yorik I.\nAnother factor is the shipping dock and the woodcutting in the Venore area. Before the Edron colony was established, the Venore area was the major source for wood needed for constrution and tools. What seems odd at the first glance, given the swamp area Venore was built in becomes more understandable when considering the next factor: Until the Druids and mages drove away all those poisonous insects and creatures the area was known for its diseases and a criminal colony in the beginning. So the merchants had a steady supply of cheap workers that had to do every job appointed to.\nThe last factor was the discovery of the Spiceweed. A special swamp grass that was soon used by cooks and households all over the continent.\nSoon enough the merchants became rich and powerfull, rivaling most of Thais noble families in wealth and power.\nFor now the merchants seem content with their station and the place Venore takes on the continent and in the kingdom. There are voices that Venore might separate one day or use it influence to wrest even more rights and privileges from the kingdom that becomes more and more dependent on its economical power."

The shamans develop this ability to such an extent, that they can sense the innermost potential of newborn orc whelps. All newborn are tested and the shamans decide a future function in orcish society. The whelps are fed differently, raised differently, and educated differently. Wise men of other races say that such behavior is similar to some insects, such as bees, and through their empathetic bond might share a kind of 'hive-mind', so they refer to orc communities as hives. The chief of a hive owns a big harem of women who have no other function than to pleasure him and give birth to new orcs. These orcish matrons are usually incredibly big and fat, almost not able to walk on their own. Where 'normal' orcwomen function as laborer and craftwomen and give birth to two to three orcs in their lives, these female orcs are only reproductive machinery, giving birth to about six whelps each half year. Orcs are usually contend with their place in orcish society and only the leaders fight each other on purpose. Rarely will an orc raise a weapon against another orc, even if they are not of the same hive. Rivalry between hives is usually dissolved through a fight of their leaders and the victorious hive absorbs the other one. Now and then, when a new strong warrior reaches maturity he challenges the old leader for a fight of supremacy. Sometimes though, when the hive becomes too big for the area it occupies, such a warrior senses somehow that its time to move on. Then he and a few other orcs leave the hive in peace to settle somewhere else. This unique culture, together with its fertility, makes the orcs the most formidable threat to all other tibian communities."

Their hideouts were additionally protected by strong illusionary magic and offered them peace from the madness around them. These elves developed due to meditation and a special philosophy in the art of dream magic, dramatically enhancing their initial abilities in the decades. So they began to exist almost permanently in a state of dreams, only rarely appearing now and then amidst the other elves to give them advice and try to convince some of them to join their way of life. As the war grew more and more fierce these visits became less and less frequent until they were almost a myth, even for elvenkind. In the new awakening of the world they were some of the first to appear, apparently far less disoriented then other beings. Many races welcomed their help, but their teachings seldom found dedicated listeners. After they taught a part of their secrets to some humans they found worthy, they had to see their pupils tortured by developments they judged themselves guilty of.  Also, other elves put pressure on the humans to give up the secrets of dreams.  They withdrew from the world of mortals and it is rumored they have physically entered the realm of dreams.\nThe Teshial are 'typical' in appearance for elves, but they could create the illusion of almost any appearance if they so choose. Some people even say that due to their enormous control of dreams they could shape their children as they wish, giving them human or even orcish appearance. On the other hand, even people who come up with such theories go silent when asked why an elf should choose to have a child that looks that way."

Adopting what they had seen from other races and things they vaguely remembered from their own past some trading posts were established in this way. Usually only one to three families lived there. After the reunification with the Cenath the majority of them could be convinced to give a permanent settlement a try and the biggest tradingpost became the settlement Ab'Dendriel.

This class of minotaurs was the only one who could live long enough to learn skills not directly connected to war. Since they were almost always the only ones who could gather enough experience and wisdom to create new ideas and concepts, the younger warriors begun to look at them as parents and advisors. Slowly these elders were able to change the war culture of the minotaurs. One charismatic minotaur in particular, Akkor, who was born blind, became the founder of the new minotaurian philosophy. He shunned the rage as a curse of the god Blog.  Consequently, the minotaurian religion, which due to the extremity of martyrdom and rage never had a real chance to develop, turned away from the raging one. Slowly new concepts were adopted and great efforts were undertaken to hold the rage at bay. Meditation and self-control became the foremost duties of any warrior. The minotaurian ideal turned towards role models who were in control of body and mind. Since fiery rage was in minotaurian nature, young minotaurs were trained from early on to control themselves. It was through meditation that the minotaurs developed art and soon philosophy. Complicated ceremonies for usually simple things of daily life were developed to focus the mind, to be aware of each second of life."

But this rage had cost more than one life and some of the most promising warriors died young on the battlefields. Heavy casualties caused their numbers to decrease dramatically. The minotaurs withdrew from the wars, but in a world gone mad, skirmishes with other races were part of their daily routine. The demise of the whole race continued. As the minotaur race became nearly extinct in the fights, they found refuge in caves, adopting a lifestyle much like their ancient enemies the dwarfs."

Old faces are vanishing and new ones are showing up. Old contacts go silent and are either found dead or disappear. Others are in fear. It is hard to peek into the new darkness that enshrouds the crime world. Whatever is happening, it is happening fast and is masterfully executed. There is strong evidence that magic is at work, but certainly no magic your average mage for hire could supply. Experts from the mage gild are in awe of the evidence we have provided. They are sure that this is not guild-sanctioned magic, neither of the sorcerers' nor the druids' guild. And according to them, it is far more refined and powerful than anything some shaman or witch doctor could do. The few people we could interrogate seem to know nothing. They are afraid and confused and receive their orders from a newly established line of command, which we could not follow up very far yet. Strangely enough, crime rates have dropped significantly. But who would actively wrest control from the underworld and then not use it in a meaningful way? This leads to the disturbing conclusion that the recent events aim at something significantly bigger and far more dangerous. We have raised security measures significantly in all areas. We are also trying to re-establish our informant network and get some insight into what is happening at all. I strongly recommend spending more resources into the investigation of this matter and even more into new security measurements, especially in the field of magic."

The world itself has become old and weary and we will soon begin to feel its death throes. The end is a natural and inevitable thing and those who work to prevent it, work against the natural order. The world has died before and will die again in the future. But each time, out of chaos and destruction it is born anew. This is the way of things. This is how it has to be. Yet, there are forces at work that cling to their power and status. They work to stall the inevitable for their own personal gain and thus, risk breaking the cycle of death and recreation. This is the time for the noble ones to rise to further the end. The few chosen will be there to help the birth of a new world. Know that each world reborn is a better version of the old. This is the way of things and this may not be stopped or tampered with. The chosen who embrace the end and help to bring forth the new world will become exalted amongst all creatures. Those who will carry the burden of birth helpers will carry the mantle of godhood in the world that is to come. Each of them will be rewarded with a status that is appropriate for the effort they put into their fight for rebirth. Those who oppose them will be denied a place in the next world and their essence will dissolve, screaming in the abyss of nothingness. Open your eyes and see the heralds of the end. Follow them and further their work to earn your place. Do not hesitate or falter. For only the dedicated will become the mightiest of gods in the world that is to come. There will be seers, blessed with insights in the needs of the world. Follow their words and orders and you are on your way into the world that is promised. Destruction is inevitable. Embrace it, cast away your fear and lust for worldly possession since fear is futile as worldly things that will be annihilated soon."

Whereas the gods hold back humanity from reaching their full potential, the hidden lord wants us to prosper and rightfully take our place to rule the world. For too long have we suffered under the claws and teeth of monstrous beings. Given the strength and number of humans, it is obvious that no one could stand against humanity's might. Yet, there they are: the green-skinned, the horned, the one-eyed and all the others. These beasts are only relics of a time gone by but the gods allow them to live on a whim. They care little that humanity suffers under them. How many times will our cities burn and our people be slaughtered until humanity understands that we mean little to the vain gods? The hidden lord has patiently watched the games of the lesser gods and he has given them every chance to see their error. But no longer. The hidden lord will rise and cast down the gods and lead humanity to its destined greatness. He is the one true god and the only one worthy to be worshipped. The imposter gods just took over a world that was perfect and built to be shaped for the arrival of the humans so they would inherit the world as the true god had wished. Instead, the imposter gods used the lesser races that were meant to be the gardeners, miners and workers for humanity and corrupted them into vile beasts that ravaged and destroyed the world. An heirloom for humanity that was never intended for those false gods. The hidden lord, aware of his power, just let them be. In his nearly unending patience, he gave them every chance to turn back and regret their mistakes. But even his patience will come to an end. And the time is near. He will elevate humanity, the crown of creation, to its rightful state. Those humans who were wise enough to see through the deceptions of the deceivers will become his lords and kings in the new world that he is going to shape. He will bless them with his power and wisdom and they will lead humanity into the age of destiny. They will rule and judge in his stead. When the hidden lord will drop his cover, the imposter gods will tremble, the false priests will be smitten and the traitorous rulers will drown in their own blood."

        "text": "Lord Lokhem the pious was a good man. In his youth he aimed to become a priest of Banor but later decided he could serve his god better as a knight. He put high standards towards others and even higher standards for himself. Almost no one found his approval. There was always some taint or fault that appalled him in human beings. all the more, however, he was appalled by himself. Whereas in others he could only assume the faults and sins, in himself he was well aware of them. His own anger, envy and greed disgusted him to no end. He felt a great evil was growing deep inside of himself. He studied the teachings of the gods and being unable to find a solution he relied on more and more dubious texts and books. Eventually, drawing from elements of different fragmented texts he devised a ritual that would ultimately cleanse him. By this ritual he planned to cast out his malignant side and destroy it once and for all. The preparations took several years and used up all of his fortune. Eventually he was ready and prepared. On the top of a mountain he scribbled ancient symbols, sung in forgotten languages and consumed elixirs of unspeakable ingredients. Three times three days he endured. In the ninth night at midnight a storm engulfed the mountaintop, without touching it. Amidst darkness and lightning from the ashes of the ritual fires a grotesque creature arose. Lord Lokhems evilness had manifested. Yet to his utter horror it was by far more huge and powerful than the puny remnants of his goodness, in a body that was exhausted by the ritual. His evil mocked him, claiming that this outcome had been its plan all along, to finally be set free. Lokhem valiantly tried to fight back by his dark self only toyed with him. Bleeding from countless wounds Lord Lokhem fell to the ground, powerless. He was still alive when he evil claimed his face for himself. Then it mercilessly slew the good side. It left to lead a life of corruption, spreading mayhem where it went. It is said that Lord Lokhems evil side, driven by memories of his research, was searching a secret library that was rumoured to contain vast knowledge. There he planned to find the spell that would free all the evil in humanity at once and give it substance. But he was overwhelmed by the guardians of the library and met his end by their hands. To honor his accomplishment to find them, the guardians granted him a proper burial."

The godbreaker seems to be some kind of myth amongst demon kind, forbidden lore even to them only to be breathed under the threat of death. It may very well be that the whole story is a lie told to demons to raise their morale, as there is no hint whatsoever to give the stories some form of cogency. The godbreaker, according to demon legends, was created at the dawn of time. It may have been a weapon used by Zathroth to kill Tibiasula, but most sources claim it was created much later, in the most heated phase of the godwars by Zathroth's own raging son, to kill his godly opponents once and for all; but then it was taken away by Zathroth and imbued with incredible enchantments and magics, never dared to be used before or later. It is said that Zathroth himself was amazed and scared by the outcome: a weapon so dreadful that even a god could not look upon it for a longer time. Zathroth ultimately deemed the weapon too strong, particularly fearing that his other half, Uman, might get hold of it and take revenge for the murder of Tibiasula. So Zathroth broke the weapon into numerous parts (most stories claim seven, others name three, four or even thirteen parts). He hid the parts at places so remote and so dangerous they never could be reclaimed by someone other than him. Should the forces of darkness ever have to fear defeat at the hands of their opponents, Zathroth would reforge the godbreaker and vanquish his enemies. Sometimes it is said he entrusted the Ruthless Seven with guarding the parts.\nSome stories even go so far to tell that Zathroth used the broken parts to create the Ruthless Seven with them, and that their unified power might be enough to kill a god."

        "text": "Theory Of Ascension I\nThe idea of ascension is not one that originated from mankind. Throughout the ages many races have toyed with the idea of ascension, for a number of reasons and with different levels of success. While many human cults argue that it is Banor's godly spark which is in all of humanity that is the key to ascension, the pre-human ascension attempts prove otherwise. Though it may be argued that this godly spark, if it exists at all, might help in an ascension process, it is, depending on the intended course of ascension, no required element. It seems that initial godly energies are inherent to all elements of creation and, as such, could be extracted and concentrated. If such a godly spark in humanity would give humans a head start in ascension, there would have to be more ascended humans than members of other races; but as it is next to impossible to classify or identify an ascended being this is still up for debate. For instance, it can't be verified if the so-called gods of the elves truly exist and if they do, whether they truly were living beings once. It becomes even more obscure in the case of vanished races or those hostile to humanity, where little verifiable information is available.\nAnother fact complicating the matter is that as numerous as the paths to ascension are, as numerous are the results. As far as humanity can tell, the major gods have been around since the time of creation. There were no additions to their ranks at all. This would leave ascendant beings with only little spheres of influence and question their success altogether. But as we are not familiar with the structure of ascendant beings in general, it is hard to make a qualified statement about their doings at all. As we don't feel the hand of the accepted gods in our daily lives, it might be possible that this is even truer for ascendant beings, and their influence might be extremely subtle. In addition, it is hard to tell if ascension something that immediately sets in. It is entirely possible that ascension makes it necessary to accustom to a new existence and to only gradually tap into the acquired powers. So all we have to work with are claims of ascension or apocryphal texts that might hint at one. Unless we find means to verify an ascended status, it is futile to concentrate any scientific research on this topic. All we can do is to look into the theories and means to achieve an assumed ascension. It is universally agreed in any ascension theory encountered that the most integral (yet not necessarily the first) step is the acquirement of enormous amounts of energy. What kind of energy is needed is already up to debate. Most theories base on the belief that it is a spiritual energy which has to be acquired. How it could be gathered and contained is of course nothing different schools can agree upon. Regardless of this fact, the amount of energy itself has to be enormous.\nThough it doesn't seem to be based on any real data, many ascensionists agree upon the fact that not everyone can ascend, but the individual has to be 'awakened'. This universal term has a variety of meanings in the different theories, however. Usually it is connected to some magic ability, where chances of success relate to the raw magic power someone commands. This implies that great mages are the most likely to succeed in ascension."

        "text": "Theory Of Ascension II\nAnother school of thought introduced the interesting concept that an ascended being must have some sort of anchor in the material world. Following this theory, an ascended being would enter a new kind of existence so different from what it experienced in life that at first, it would be extremely disoriented and confused, drifting through a sphere of gods and losing contact to creation in the limitless realm, before regaining its senses. However, as with all parts of ascension theories, the structure of such an anchor is hotly debated. Many see the beliefs of people as some sort of anchor, additionally providing some source of constant energy. Some go so far as to postulate that even the gods of creation might need such an anchor, lest they'd drift literally into obscurity. Others claim that the gods are bound to their creation and the part that they incorporate and do not need of other anchors, reasoning that in the beginning there was no one who could have believed in them to begin with. Though many texts assume a quite a rather fast, violent and critical process, others see this kind of transcendence as a gradual process which requires a lot of time but happens in a more natural way. If truly some of the bygone races managed ascension, the lack or loss of their anchor might explain their apparent absence from the affairs of modern mankind.\nAnother part, many of the schools agree upon, is the initial breakthrough. It is assumed that an ascending being has to somehow breach the walls that separate the world of the living from the realm of the gods. Sometimes this act is compared to a bird, hatching from an egg.\nWith the three parts in place we have a rough concept of ascension: the energy, the anchor and the transcendence.\nQuite a lot of the recorded attempts of ascension followed this basic concept. Though most seem to be based on a religion forming around the ascensionist, this might only seem to be so because such incidents are better recorded and more obvious.\nThe few recorded attempts of ascension seem to suggest that the ascensionist, shortly before starting the process, is at the height of his worldly power. At a given point of ascension those beings (who met some form of success) are beyond the powers available to man. Walking gods in their own right, they are no longer fully part of creation and seem less bound to its laws. In the process of transcendence, the entity is extremely powerful but not fully aware of its potential and partly distracted by the ascension itself. This is the moment when the process is in its most fragile state. It is at that stage when most attempts fail, sometimes with catastrophic consequences, depending on the chosen means of ascending.\nThough no successful ascension has been verified by science, it is strongly assumed that some ascensionists met with success. Considering that the outcome is likely to be affected by the means of achieving ascension, it is probably only a matter of time until a rather violent and active new god emerges who shuns the subtlety of his predecessors."

The entrance to the lower temple areas is protected by an old and powerful enchantment. I studied the inscriptions on the temple walls and thus learned that the key to the inner sanctum is the passing of three tests. The first test is the Lion's Strength. In order to honour the site's mystical cats of prey one has to hunt and slay a cobra. The cobra's tongue must be laid down at a stone statue as a sacrifice. The second test is the Lion's Beauty. One has to burn the petals of a lion's mane flower on a coal basin. In the sand at the rock's foot I saw some dried lion's mane petals. Maybe these flowers grow somewhere upwards. The third test is called the Lion's Tears. It seems one has to purify an ornamented stone pedestal with ...\" At this point the records end because the parchment is destroyed.

They are warriors of some power and very dangerous in greater numbers. Luckily enough, there are not many of their more skilled fighters around, like the berserker or warrior. Still, a handful of them is enough to get an adventurer into dire straits.\nThe goblin - sneaky and devious, goblins steal everything that is not nailed down. Though small and relatively easy to fight, they don't shirk from attacking humans when they feel superior in numbers. They normally stay in their hideouts underground, where they hoard their loot.\nThe minotaur - a dreaded beast and fearsome fighter, the minotaur is a formidable foe for a young adventurer.  Particular caution should be exercised when going to their lair underground, as they have some skilled archers and even some mages that may kill you very, very quickly.\nOther beasts - It is certain that other beasts live in the dungeons of our isle.

They are usually accompanied by a host of smaller worms which makes them even more dangerous. Carrion worms have some sort of tusks that can easily penetrate a good armor.\nThe skeletons - Skeletons are living undead, rumoured to be the bodies of dead adventurers which have been revived by some evil power. Cropping up in packs and occasionally accompanied by other undead creatures like ghouls or mummies, they are quite nasty opponents, particularly because they are able to drain the life energy of their opponents.\nThe bat - Often encountered in caves and ruins, along with other creatures, sometimes undead. Being little stronger than a rat, bats are rather a nuisance than a threat to an experienced adventurer. Their attacks on humans mainly happen out of self-defence. Bats often form a large swarm which is slightly more dangerous to face than a single specimen. Bats can be found almost everywhere as long as there is some close-by dark place where they can breed and sleep.\nThe rat - Whether humans brought this pest with them on the isle or whether rats are indigenous to every dark place in Tibia is anyone's guess. However, rats on Dawnport normally prefer to live underground and are mostly harmless, tending to destroy food supplies in cellars. They can become dangerous in greater numbers, though, to any badly equipped adventurer they corner."

Like the damselfly, their diet consists of plant matter and smaller insects though they too attack passersby, supposedly to guard their territory. Their bite is slightly poisonous, but poses a threat only to the wounded or completely unprepared wanderer.\nThe woodling - The woodlings could be the missing link between the swamplings and the haunted treelings. Half plant and half animal and at least partially intelligent, treelings love to ambush their prey and make use of the surroundings to drive it into a corner. Looking deceptively tree-like, a woodling will make a grab at any human that passes; supposedly to spice up its diet of rotting leaves and plants with something more juicy. Woodlings can slow down their enemies and are quite tough, which is why any inexperienced adventurer would do well to know the way back to the outpost in a hurry if venturing down to the woody plains.\nThe Meadow strider - A giant bird that stalks the marshes and meadows, the meadow strider usually feeds on small insects and amphibians. Being very territorial but short-sighted, it will attack any supposed rival of its own size, which includes humans, and peck at them. Though they are nearly as tough as woodlings, there's good eating on a meadow strider, and they often contain swallowed gold coins and other useful stuff."

If there's nothing else, you can always eat a hunch of wolf, and sell its fur.\nThe bear - Bears are hard to beat! Keep that in mind before challenging one. If you are inexperienced and don't have good equipment, retreat is the tactic of choice. Best kill bears in small hunting parties and use terrain to your advantage.\nThe deer - Deers are a fine supply for food and are non-agressive animals and try to flee on sight. It might be difficult to catch them and you might easily enter the territory of a local predator while chasing them.\nThe hare - Like deers, hares will flee upon sight and are an excellent source of food for any passing adventurer. They are a common sight in the meadows and forests of Tibia, though larger predators are never very far.\nThe squirrel - Swift and impish, squirrels will run from any human they see. Hunters avoid preying on squirrels, as there is a legend that says that the giant immortal Squirrels who ate nuts from Crunor's blessed tree take bloody revenge on each and every killer of their descendants. Squirrels are found in woody areas all over Tibia."

        "text": "Genesis I. The Awakening of the Gods\nIn the beginning there was only a big, gaping void. It was everywhere and nowhere.\nIn this emptiness two powerful entities appeared who were eventually known as the elder gods: Fardos the Creator and Uman Zathroth who combined in himself two unequal halves. One of these halves was Uman the Wise, a benign god who was gifted with divine intellect, while Zathroth the Destroyer was the other, darker half. These were the two halves of one single enigmatical entity, and even though either of them was perfectly capable of acting on his own just as if he had been fully independent, independent they were not. They were bound together by an eternal bond that could not be broken, and their destiny was one.\nNobody knows where the elder gods came from, or whether they had always existed and eventually awoke from the slumber of infinity. But somewhere along the way they decided to create a universe. Surely Fardos was the initiator, for he was driven by the need to create and give life. He was overflowing with creative power and impatient to release it, so he stepped into existence and began to unleash his powers. However, none of his attempts to create were successful. All of his creations were swallowed by the void before they were completed, and none survived.\nUman Zathroth regarded Fardos's undertakings thoughtfully. Uman was sagacious and held awesome magical powers. Most importantly, however, he was driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge and enlightenment. In his essence he resembled Fardos, but where Fardos worked openly and logically, Uman's domain was the realm of mystery. Still, he shared Fardos's interest in creation, whereas his dark half Zathroth was essentially corruptive. Zathroth was a vain god who was painfully aware that his own creative powers were poor. Because of this he looked at Fardos's work of creation with jealousy, and from the very beginning he was determined to prevent or at least corrupt it in any way he could. Fardos, who did not suspect this, asked him for assistance because he had accepted the fact that he could not achieve creation on his own, but of course Zathroth denied. Uman, however, agreed to help. And from that he and Fardos worked together on the great project that was creation.\nUnfortunately, their combined efforts were hardly more successful. Just like before, everything Fardos and Uman created was swallowed by the void as soon as it came into existence, and the two gods sadly saw their creation run through their fingers like water through a sieve. On the other hand, Zathroth, who had been watching their efforts with suspicion, rejoiced. He ridiculed their efforts. However, his glee changed into surprise and anger when he found that something strange happened, something which perhaps Uman and Fardos did not expect themselves. To this day, nobody knows precisely what it was that caused it. Perhaps the power that had been spent lured another entity out of the void, or it might be that it simply awoke another divine entity from its slumber. Some even claim that in some mysterious way the power that had been spent by Uman and Fardos actually created a new entity. Whatever the truth may be, a new goddess stepped out of the void like a new-born mermaid from her shell. The amazed elder gods watched her divine beauty in awed admiration, for everything in her was perfect harmony. They agreed to call her Tibiasula. Zathroth, however, stood by and fumed with silent hate. But cunning as he was, he hid his resentment well and feigned to share the joy of the other elder gods."

        "text": "Genesis IV. The First Creatures\nZathroth watched the progress of creation with wrath and disgust. If he had had his way, he would have obliterated creation then and there. However, he knew that he lacked the power to do that, especially since Fardos and Uman were now well aware of his intentions and watched him carefully. He would have to resort to other means to bring ruin to creation. It was for this reason that he watched the concept of life with great interest, because he foresaw quite clearly that a lot of mischief could be done with it. Much as he loathed most of the gods that had been created, there was one who had caught his attention. Fafnar's base instincts and her destructive powers did not fail to impress him, and so a plan came to his mind. He flattered her with compliments and before long he succeeded in seducing her. Thus Brog the Raging Titan was conceived. An exceedingly ugly abomination that had only one eye in its huge head, Brog had inherited little of his father's cunning and none of his caution, yet he was strong and fierce, and his mother's furious heat burned wildly inside him.\nAs he grew up, Brog was pained by the fire burning inside him, until one day when it grew unbearable he summoned all his magical powers and released as much of the painful flame into the world as he could. The searing fire mixed with his rage, and from it rose Garsharak, the very first dragon, who later sired a whole race of intelligent, giant lizards, a race that would eventually bring terror and chaos into Tibia. Brog watched the terrible creature he had created rather accidentally, and he rejoiced when he saw just how fierce and powerful it was. Though he was rather stupid he, too, had the gift to create life, which in an act of vanity he next used to create the cyclopes in his own image.\nZathroth watched Brog's experiments with great interest. So far he had not held his son in high esteem, but here was something for which he himself admittedly had little talent for. Since he did not understand the laws of life himself he knew that Brog's gift could prove to be a great asset. He called his son to him and told him to go on with his experiments, urging him to create something more terrifying and destructive than cyclopes. Even though these giants were ferocious and strong, they were not quite as destructive as he wanted them to be. In fact, due to their love of mining and smithing the cyclopes were a creative rather than a destructive race. Worse, they were not propagating fast enough to make them a real threat to creation. For this reason Brog went on to create trolls and goblins, races that were weaker than the cyclopes, but propagated much faster. However, his undisputed masterpiece were the orcs, a race of fearsome, single-minded warriors who lived only to expand and conquer. Soon they had spread all over Tibia, and they were the scourge of all that was alive."

In the wars over creation they were one of the most successful races. But as the war grew more and more fierce it were the wild and raging minotaurs that had to pay the worst blood toll. The berserker rage inherent to their race made them a formidable opponent but also very vulnerable.\nThough victorious in most battles, in the end the berserking warriors had to surrender to their wounds or were left crippled and executed and fed to Blogs lesser followers. Even worse, the raging minotaurs knew neither friend nor enemy. Brother slew brother, fathers slaughtered their sons in their rage. Then, one day a minotaur, named Tha'kull conquered his rage. He withdrew from battle and became a hermit. In his travels he met Akkor, the blind one. This minotaur was by fate not subjected to the rage inherent to the minotauren race and had aquired a tranquility and wisdom, unknown to his kind so far. Tha'Kull thaught the blind one how to improve his body and fortitude and Akkor in return teached the warrior how to improve his soul.\nHe looked upon the world and for the first time in aeons a minotaurean warrior saw the world without hatred. He saw the beauty in things, simple and complex. He saw the harmony in creation and the place the living had in it. He also saw the place that was meant to be taken by the sentient beings among the living. And he went back to his people to teach. Never a warrior of the minotaurs had neglected his rage and even though he was cautious the angry berserker warlords would not allow the words he spoke to be heard by their people."

To be sure, the humans' expansion has met with fierce resistance, and in fact the dauntless heroes who still enter this world from the mysterious Portals of Souls are busy enough to fight the constant threat posed by all kinds of hostile creatures. But so far the peace has lasted, and under its protection the human race has finally asserted itself as the dominant species in Tibia. However, there are disquieting signs that this glorious era might slowly come to its end. For the old enemies have never been vanquished, and now it seems that they are growing increasingly restless. The fierce orcs are stirring once more, attacking human settlements and sometimes even major cities in vicious, well-coordinated attacks. The undead have again started to walk the land, striking fear into the hearts of the living. There are even disconcerting reports that the fearsome dragons who have lain dormant for centuries are again leaving their hidden lairs to prey. Worst of all, the humans, that curious race, have started bickering amongst themselves, and more than once tensions have led to armed conflicts. In the course of time, some humans even renounced the Thaian kings' rule and founded own cities and empires.\nIt may be that this is yet another one of Zathroth's wicked ploys. It is well known that his most diabolic minions, the gruesome demons, are lurking in the shadows, biding their time. Who knows - perhaps Tibia is on the brink of another cataclysmic war, and a new twilight will fall on the world. Fate alone knows what the future has in store for Tibia. Let us all hope and pray that the humans' unity will not break just when it is needed most."

        "text": "V.i Part 1: The Age of Chaos\nUman looked with sadness at the damage his evil half had done to the creation Fardos and he had worked for so hard. He felt that Zathroth had finally gone too far. In his desperation he turned to Fardos for advice. Together, they decided that it would be best to sever the bond between Uman and Zathroth once and for all. They set about to this task with great energy, and their efforts soon enough appeared to be crowned with success. However, the weaker the bond between Uman and Zathroth became, the weaker Uman himself grew, and in the end they realised that the duality could not be separated without endangering Uman's very existence. At last the invocation was aborted. Uman had to accept the fact that the duality between Zathroth and himself could not be broken, and that their fate and indeed their very existence were intertwined for eternity.\nHowever, Uman's and Fardos's joint efforts did not remain entirely without consequence, for during the unsuccessful attempt to separate the double god a small part broke away from it. This tiny shard grew and expanded until it took shape and eventually became a sentient creature of its own. This was the hour Kirok the Mad was born. Owing to his peculiar ancestry this strange god has a twisted or, as some say, a schizophrenic nature. He inherited Uman's creative mind and his inquisitive nature, so that he eventually became the patron god of all those who follow the path of science and research. However, the one trait Kirok is really famous for is his twisted sense of humour. He adores bad taste and ingenious pranks, and this peculiar characteristic makes him the favourite of bards, jesters and of all other kinds of suspicious people.\nWhile Fardos and Uman were working hard on their spell, Zathroth's minions went on to lay waste to the elder gods' precious creation, and the devastation continued without pause. It seemed as though the whole world was doomed to perish. However, some of the lesser gods who were tired of just standing by while their beloved Tibia was ravaged. They decided to put up resistance against the reckless hordes. Bastesh the Mistress of the Sea created huge, mysterious creatures that were both elegant and fierce, and she populated her beloved ocean with them to make sure Zathroth's minions would never defile its pure waters. However, there was little she could do to help her cousins who lived on the dry land. Of all her creatures the only ones to survive on land were the dextrous and venomous snakes. Crunor and Nornur, too, created creatures to fight against Brog's and Zathroth's hordes: Crunor the Lord of the Trees created fierce wolves, while Nornur equipped his beloved spiders with deadly poison to make them more powerful."

The wolves' hides and the spiders chitinous exoskeletons could not resist the steel of the orcish blades, and for every troll that was brought down by poison two others came to take his place. In the end gods' children withdrew to areas that were easy to defend: The wolves fled into the depths of the forests, while the spiders hid deep in caves. There they continued their fights, defending their realms against the onslaught of the superior enemy. These little pockets of resistance were the only sanctuaries in a world that sank deeper and deeper into chaos. And the worst was yet to come, for now the dragons felt the time had come to take what was theirs by right!\nFor centuries they had propagated and expanded in silence, largely unnoticed by all other creatures. But now that Garsharak, the very first and strongest of their race, sent them into the world they knew neither restraint nor mercy. The orcish armies were routed by the relentless flames of magical dragon fire, and soon that proud though barbaric race, who until then had not known the meaning of the word defeat, was driven into the shelter of subterranean settlements. Their allies, the mighty cyclopes, fared no better. Although they won a number of notable victories using their powerful weapons and armour, they, too, had to yield to the superior power of the dreaded dragons. They joined their former allies, the orcs, and their weak cousins, the trolls, in their subterranean exile. Their proud cities that had been built in the course of centuries were burnt down to the ground, and their renowned forges were lost forever.\nThus the dragons had taken over the rule of the land, but the war was by no means over. Their bitter enemies, cyclopes and orcs, resented what they felt was an imprisonment in the bowels of the earth, and they continued the fight from their subterranean hideouts. And in fact the dragons, who had already been weakened in the course of the previous battles, suffered serious losses. But now war also erupted among the former allies, as cyclopes and orcs competed for food and space in their subterranean abodes. And even though no side was strong enough to overcome the others the war went on with undiminished force, and all of the races suffered greatly in the epic struggle. The land was scattered with bodies, and while it seemed that life itself would be wiped from the face of Tibia the losses of all races that were involved daily grew in number. It was as if the living would drown in the bodies of the slain."

        "text": "V. ii, The Age of Chaos\nThe elder gods watched as the cataclysmic battle went on. They felt no pity for those that were slain because they cared little for Zathroth's creatures, but they knew that something was missing, that somebody was needed to take care of the bodies and souls of those who ceased to live. They began to look for a solution, and finally Uman proposed that a new god should be created, a god who should see to it that the dead would be taken care of. They decided that earth, which in a way was the giver of life, should have a part in taking it back, and that Uman should be the newly created god's father. But alas! The elder gods were not as cautious as they should have been, and so Zathroth the Destroyer learnt about their plans all too soon. He was fascinated by the idea of death from the start, because he saw in it a new chance to bring further havoc and destruction into the world. Soon he had devised a vicious plan. He posed as his good half Uman to fool earth, and with it he sired another god: Urgith the Master of the Undead. This hideous deity was devoted to death just like the god Uman and Fardos had in mind, but he was not the benign guardian of the dead they had envisioned. Instead, Urgith was a cruel god who strove to infuse the bodies of the dead with unholy energy, dooming them to a state that was neither life nor death. Thus, the hour of Urgith's birth marked the beginning of undeath.\nSoon enough innumerable undead roamed the world. After all, Tibia was still covered by countless bodies of slain orcs, cyclopes and other creatures - the legacy of the many years of ceaseless war. These cadavers provided Urgith with the ideal recruitment pool, and he eagerly transformed all carcasses he could lay his hands into his gruesome servants. The gods watched in horror as a new scourge ravaged their beloved creation. They hurried to finally put their own initial plan into practice, and Uman united with earth in order to sire Toth the Warden of the Souls. It was to be his mission to safely guide the souls of the dead to the otherworld, where they would safely rest in the peace of an eternal dreamless slumber, while the worms, his faithful servants, swarmed out to devour their bodies that scattered the face of Tibia. But the damage had been done, and even though Toth and his servants did the best they could Urgith's ghastly creations continued to roam the land. All the other creatures, who were already greatly weakened by their endless wars, could put up little resistance to the new enemy who increased in strength with every loss they suffered. It looked as if Tibia was forever doomed to be a world that was inhabited by the living dead.\nThe elder gods looked at what had happened to their world, and their hearts filled with sorrow and resentment. They knew that if they did not act now Tibia would be destined to become a grave, and so they started looking for a solution. Eventually they agreed to try to create a sentient race of their own, a race that would be strong enough to take up the fight against the hordes that ravaged their beloved world. And so they created a race and sent it into Tibia. But alas! Urgith's minions were too strong. Their race was defeated within a generation, and it was wiped from the face of Tibia. So Uman and Fardos created race after race, and race after race was overwhelmed by the vicious abominations that Urgith had released into the world. Most of these races disappeared from the face of Tibia forever, leaving little but melancholy legends and mysterious ruins. Today, this sad era which is commonly known as the Corpse War is largely shrouded in mystery, and the unfortunate races that were destroyed in it are now referred to as the ancients."

At least two of the races created by the elder gods in the course of this epic struggle somehow managed to escape destruction and to survive until today. One of them was the elves, delicate creatures who could handle bows and musical instruments with equal skill. The other was the dwarfs, a stout race of gifted miners and smiths. Both of these races fought bravely, but both of them had to yield to the vicious power of their enemies, and it was only by fleeing into safe places of refuge that they managed to survive. The elves after many hardships sought shelter in the unfathomable depths of the forests, while the dwarfs barricaded themselves in their impenetrable fortresses deep in Tibia's mountains. There, these races waited for better times, bitterly deploring the cruel fate that had sent them into this dreadful world. But at least they had survived. All the other ancient races were seemingly sentenced to oblivion, although it is occasionally claimed that there are other survivors.\nFor all their strength, these races had one important flaw in common: They lacked flexibility. And this proved to be fatal in the war against the relentless enemy they were facing. Those who were not annihilated succumbed to Zathroth's temptations. More than one of the ancients fell for Zathroth's cunning promises of power and knowledge, and legend has it that the wrathful elder gods brutally punished many of them for their treachery. There is even a persistent theory that some of these ancients later on were formed by the devious Zathroth into the very first demons. Be that as it may, all the ancients failed to live up to their creators' expectations: One by one they were overwhelmed by the enemy, and still the hordes walked the world. But the elder gods had learnt from their mistakes. Their next creation was to be well suited for the task. And they called them the humans."

Some ancient creatures were possessed of a far-reaching will to conquer and subdue all others through their thoughts alone, while the newer beings could weave magic in defense or had strength and swiftness to defend and escape the wiles laid out to ensnare them. Some animals and plants, simple though they may seem to us, yet are deadly poisonous in order to ward off their hunter.\nBut only the more intelligent beings - and of those, only a select few - possess the art of making powerful concoctions that enhance their faculties.\nThe humble woodman or wanderer will never be able to fulfil the complex rites, or even grasp the concept, of the trimagical umbralistic principle of the equinox formula that is crucial to the craft of magical potions.\nBut still, they can drink, and appreciate, the brews we make to keep a warrior's body alive in a fight, the mage's mana when drained, the paladin's spirit when they need to gather holy force. ...

Eventually they agreed to try to create a sentient race of their own, a race that would be strong enough to take up the fight against the hordes that ravaged their beloved world. And so they created a race and sent it into Tibia. But alas! Urgith's minions were too strong. Their race was defeated within a generation, and it was wiped from the face of Tibia. So Uman and Fardos created race after race, and race after race was overwhelmed by the vicious abominations that Urgith had released into the world. Most of these races disappeared from the face of Tibia forever, leaving little but melancholy legends and mysterious ruins. Today, this sad era which is commonly known as the Corpse War is largely shrouded in mystery, and the unfortunate races that were destroyed in it are now referred to as the Ancients.\n..."

Some of them manage to stay in the world of the living as some form of ghost or undead, but most of them simply move on to the afterlife. But even there, some of them simply don't give up. And as there is little in the world as persistent and diligent as a bad entertainer, many of them stay at the border between the two realms and contemplate their ill fates. They mourn the fame they never acquired and which they feel was unjustly stolen from them. They partner with similar minded individuals and complain to each other how cruel the world has treated them. Of course none of them is actually listening to each other because they are too absorbed with their own misery. So they grow louder and louder and over the course of time, their monologues are heard everywhere in the plain of death.\nSadly, one of the things even more persistent and diligent as a bad entertainer is a whole bunch of them. In the end, they grow that loud and annoying that the guardians of the gates of death themselves lose their patience. So once a year they throw the annoying fools out and banish them to the realm of the living, knowing that they would not stay there for long given their annoying nature.\nSo once a year hordes of undead jesters raid the cities where they once were seeking fame and glory. As undead, they try to terrorise the living, however, as they are even worse as undead than they are as entertainers they pose only a minor threat. Usually they find themselves back in the afterworld quite soon, and for another year, they dream of greatness that was never theirs."

This network seems to have been some kind of communication device and knowledge storage. Almost like a library, the Shapers had access to it as long as they were close enough to certain transmitting towers. At the height of the Shapers' power those towers must have dotted the whole world. The Shapers became not only highly dependent on this network but also highly addicted to it. Even more, most of their communication was handled via this network. When it was destroyed, the single Shaper was overwhelmed by loneliness and lack of information. Moreover, they had lost the ability to teach younger generations without using their network. It was reported that some Shapers that found refuge by other non-hostile races became passive and depressed, sometimes they even refused to drink or to eat. This explains the swift vanishing of the race. When something that had been an integral part of their culture all of a sudden no longer existed, they were unable to cope with the changed circumstances."

To reach the hoard is to unify the greatest and most complex secrets of the world. It means to understand them in such a natural way they can be weaved into a universal pattern that allows understanding the inner workings of the world. This would be an amount of knowledge that could only be called 'godly'. Of course no mortal being could reach such a level of understanding. The followers of this path strife for it nonetheless. This knowledge is by definition only limited, a mere stepping stone to the next level of understanding on a never ending staircase. The assumption that a hoard would actually need a physical representation of knowledge on the other hand, seems rather blasphemous. Why would a god need books and why would a god of secret knowledge risk to accumulate all forbidden knowledge at one place I ask? The story about Zathroth's hoard of knowledge is just that, a story. Everything else is a ridiculous theory of past days of unenlightenment."

In the end it seems a group of demons found some race that had taken refuge from the wars of the gods in some remote place. Several times, the demons attacked that race to steal some powerful relic or something like that from them.

The frost, who was quite tired from his long walk, could not resist and fell asleep. Quickly Marl put his hand into the frost's chest and stole his heart. With the heart in his hands, Marl also had the powers of the frost. So he constructed himself a palace completely made of ice and ruled over a land where every day was spring. As the the neighbouring king heard about this, he got envious and decided to invade the kingdom of Marl with his army. But Marl's people were peaceful and were not trained in any fighting. So the army reached the castle of Marl almost unchallenged. And Marl came out of the castle, pleading the army to leave. But they laughed at him and demanded his surrender. Then Marl took the frost's heart and threw it to the ground where it shattered. In that very moment everything on both realms was frozen with a thick layer of ice and each and everyone died. And the frost returned to power, but without a heart he was even more merciless than before."

Only the civilised people who live on this world have the same magic style, no matter their race: humans, the elves in Ab'Dendriel the Beautiful and even the dwarfs in their underearth city, Kazordoon. There is only one spot that is completely isolated from magic in the whole world, and that is the island known as Rookgaard, where no magic can be cast - perhaps some Dark Ritual made it impossible, who knows.\nIn the civilised world, not all have the same skill with or amount of magic power, commonly known as 'mana', but this will be explained in the next book."

Their quarrel over knighthood under their king and the search for more purpose in their knightly duties drove them far away from Edron. Each of them founded a seclusive order but little is known about their paths during the following years. This book tries to summarise all facts known to Tibian historians as of this day.\n(the book goes on about the orders and their founding figures, some specific passages draw your attention)\nThe leader of the Order of the Falcon (Oberon Etzel) was the first to found his own order. He saw himself and his men as true successors of King Xenom. Dismay over the King's opinions and politics led the dedicated knight to build a new order. On the foundations of law, extreme loyalty and dedication to chivalric virtues, the Order of the Falcon was established, not least as a strong signal in King Xenom's direction. Oberon Etzel's following was devout and dedicated to an extreme. Tolerated by the King at first in honour of the knight's former service, they were soon sidelined and ultimately their decisions were seen as those of of outsiders. Soon, the notion \"Trapped Falcons\" or \"Falcon Cage\" (referring to their Edron stronghold) was shaped by nobles and common folk alike. It is widely assumed among historians that these circumstances led to a self-imposed exile by the angered Oberon Etzel.\n(the book also contains excerpts from an Edron report of the assumed dissolution and exile of the Order of the Falcon, commissioned by the late king Xenom himself)\n(...) Among a multitude of other questions, stemming from the seclusive and secretive nature of the successor order, what makes this case most interesting in historical debates is the seemingly immediate disappearance of Oberon Etzel and his knights. The stronghold was reportedly abandoned over night with no trace of the order itself or any hints concerning their whereabouts. Eyewitnesses confirmed vibrant lights and unnerving sounds originating from the top of the stronghold during many nights. Not many dared venture close enough to the perimeter to catch a glimpse of what really happened there. Reports are varied and inconsistent. Apparently lights were also seen in the night before the one that marked the disappearance of the honourable order. It is worth mentioning that the order hosted several guests and workers almost all the time. Despite their dispute with the king and the other Etzel siblings, the order was generally considered honourable and trust-worthy. No notable suspicions have been raised during the time and until the disappearance there have been no noteworthy incidents. The disappearance seems to be connected to several high ranking officials from various cities which have been reported as missing during or around the time in question. Aside from various personally delivered invitations, no real connections could be made. (...)"

They disagree, however, in the details on how exactly the vile Magician managed to do this. While some claim he was the favoured of Zathroth, others argue that he breached the library's defenses and somehow stole a part of the knowledge. Even in this the specifics are debated. An intriguing variant claims, Ferumbras once was the head librarian of the shrouded hoard. Once a kind and caring man, he became more and more obsessed with the knowledge in his care and the insights he gained turned him cynical and jaded. At some point his ambitions and power became too dangerous and he was expelled from the library. The most outlandish tales even make him a physical manifestation of forbidden knowledge. The story goes that Zathroth, who obsessively accumulated knowledge, did not care about it's containment. The knowledge was powerful though that mere books could not keep it and it seeped into the library, absorbed more and more forbidden knowledge until it became sentient and created itself a physical vessel that fled the library, later becoming known as Ferumbras. Based on the the few sources available, sages of that topic suggest that Ferumbras was the descendant of a member of the brotherhood of bones that fled and got into hiding after their forces suffered a major defeat. Ferumbras was supposedly raised in secrecy and taught in the ways and secrets of the brotherhood. Since this would not explain his immense power in one way or the other, Zathroth's library seems an all too easy and convenient explanation for his stellar rise to power. Others attribute this to his bloodline, which included the likes of Goshnar and dates back to the first magician kings of Ankrahmun who unified their people against the lizard threat."

First of all, the magic the Yalahari used for their golem creation might as well be based on a entirely different magic system. Just like we cannot use the magic of the mysterious voodoo with our scholarly magic, it might be similarly impossible to use the Yalahari ritual if we were able to get hold of it. It is far more likely that we will have to understand what the ritual does and then try to recreate its effects with our own magical approach. I do not need to point out what a tedious and time consuming process that would require. It is entirely possible that the process would last more than a lifetime to be accomplished. Even if we stumbled on the original ancient rituals involved in the process of golem creation and found the used magic to be similar to our own, we would still face the problem that we were playing with forces which we do not really understand which involves certain risks that better be avoided (but I know that I am talking to deaf ears here given your eagerness to follow your ideas).\nAt a last point I want to remind you that magic as the predominant science in our world has made most other sciences almost obsolete. So we know certainly less about metallurgy and mechanics than the Yalahari did. I strongly recommend to consult the dwarfish technomancers on this issue. They possess the most knowledge concerning these subjects in our world and though they are not known to share their knowledge with outsiders, they might be the only way to gain a glimpse of understanding the nature of the mechanical golems.\nAs long as we do not get help from the technomancers, I strongly recommend to concentrate your researches on the rituals, and to use parts of old and destroyed golems you might acquire one way or the other for your studies. It would not be useful for your researches to wear out your mental and physical resources by trying to solve both problems at once.\nI will continue my own researches as good as possible from here and keep you informed of every progress I make.\nYour friend M."

        "text": "Yalahari Worker Golems - A Treatise\nThe specific golems that are used by the Yalahari have certain features that distinguish them from the more commonly known elemental golems. While certain physiological features are quite obvious, the most important difference is their mind function. They certainly possess some degree of intelligence that surpasses the instinctive level on which lesser elementals operate. Yet, they seem to lack a great deal of impulsiveness and individuality that is common among elementals. Like other golems some basic tasks can be implemented into their minds, and like parrots they can learn some basic phrases which they, unlike parrots, can use in an intelligent and intentional way. Actually their level of intelligence is only rivalled by certain necromantic golems and constructs that have been created by implanting existing spirits into the constructed body. Their lack of individuality makes it quite easy to control them, which by itself would already classify them as the most useful minions. However, what really lets them shine in the area of artificial servants is the composition of their brain (if the centre of a golem's consciousness can be called that way). Their brain is a certain crystal structure, not too different from the one of the rare crystal golems. Now, the most impressive breakthrough the Yalahari accomplished in the area of golem creation is the duplication of brain patterns from one crystal to another. That way the Yalahari were able to duplicate a certain behaviour of a trained golem into newly created golems. For this reason, newly created golems were almost instantly useful and ready for work. As an interesting side note, the same or at least a quite similar technique was used by the Yalahari to operate certain apparatuses and their so-called factories in which highly modified golems created objects in mass production. The usage of crystals by the ancient Yalahari must have been enormous.\nFor their golems they used the easy controllable mindset of their crystal-stored mind patterns with an endurable and easy producible body of rather cheap metal. For that, they constructed basic metal castings that worked like enormous metal puppets. Using complicated but standardised clockwork mechanisms, they enabled these bodies to use certain forms of movement that usually followed the patterns of natural movement. The movement was amplified by the ingenious usage of physics and metallurgy as well as miniature steam engines.\nSo far the creation of Yalahari golems is comprehensible, even if the mechanic of a golem's body is not fully understood and not reproducible with ordinary metal and alloys. What really baffled the scientific community was the way the two parts, the crystal core or brain and the mechanical clockwork body, worked together. It is quite certain that it has to do with magnetism, electricity and heat but the details are completely unclear. There certainly exists an overall enchantment on the golem but it seems so minor that it is supplementary at best.\nIt seems that in our days no new golems are created anymore, so we must assume that the secret of golem creation might be lost. On the other hand, there is still a great number of existing golems and Yalahari artefacts that can be studied. This might be a chance to either recreate or emulate the process of golem creation which would lead to a tremendous breakthrough in the magical sciences."

        "text": "Your Golem and You Volume 3\nThe second kind of known golems are necromantic golems. Some scientists of high renown question the relation between the two groups of golems but certain similarities hint at a common source.\nTo create a necromantic golem a special vessel is created and prepared. Then a spirit is forced into the body. In a third step the body is animated and becomes some sort of prison for the bound spirit.\nThe similarity lies in the preparation of the body. The following ritual that forces a spirit into the body shows a striking resemblance of the ritual to create a consciousness in elemental golems. While in an elemental golem the created consciousness is by nature bound to the condensed core, the consciousness of a necromantic golem is the spirit that is bound into the golem.\nThe form of the necromantic golem is almost neglectable as the bound spirit is usually that of an humanoid who would have difficulties operating a body that has other physical features than a humanoid. The spirits bound by the ritual are usually old and drained that have lost conciousness long ago. Those souls are weak but connect best with the enchantments of the prepared body. Even if some malignant spirit is drawn into the construct, it usually becomes not the core consciousness but technically possesses the original weak soul instead.\nSometimes the creator of a necromantic golem manages to use the head or the brain of a deceased as focus to force the original soul to become the core of the necromantic golem. As this is already possible shortly after death, the anguish that originates from the reconnection with the world of the living causes severe damage to the sentience of the creature and leaves the construct usually mad and demented. Though the whole practice of necromancy is questionable at best, the latter experiments are only frivolous flirts with disaster and are doomed to failure.\nEven if the creation of necromantic golems can also be seen as another form of raising undead, it has become a science of its own. Skilful necromancers created fascinating variants of the basic ritual to bind animal spirits into corpses that can come in different shapes and sizes, and some even managed to create golems out of single body parts like hands.\nThe secrecy and prohibitions from which necromancy suffers led to an imbalance between a very small number of competent scientists and a large amount of self-styled necromancers that mess around without the necessary skills. They experiment with incomplete rituals and poor material substitutes resulting in much trouble and many accidents. Even if they live long enough to move further in theirs studies, those self-styled necromancers show neither knowledge nor respect to the roots of necromancy."

        "text": "Your Golem and You Volume 2\nThe most common materials for golems are closely related to the element earth. Here the basic material follows the rule that the less hard the material in question is, the more easy it is to condense it to consciousness. The common assumption that softer materials are more prone to burnout, power failures and malfunctions is a misconception. Technically, the \"soft\" golems are not more faulty than their harder counterparts. Everyday praxis though shows that much less skill is needed to create them, so less skilled enchanters usually choose softer materials for their golems, leading to the great number of failures. Still, there is an issue with durability as the softer material is more vulnerable to the ravages of time than harder one. This can be compensated by the skill of the caster though. In theory, a caster that creates the easier \"soft\" golems can put more effort into the perfection of the durability of the enchantment. When creating a harder golem, he has to put more attention to the condensation of the consciousness and can spent less effort on durability. Given the different inherent durability of softer and harder golems, all in all the durability should be roughly the same.\nThe most common material for a golem is clay. It is quite easy to activate and the material allows easy additional, supplemental manipulation like the engraving of runes and glyphs that enhance the control over the entity or add certain capabilities. Clay is closely followed by certain forms of stone, though here significantly more talent is needed for the rituals. This is followed by various forms of metal. The manipulation of metal is not trivial though and the rate of failure rises tremendously. The most difficult creations are those made of crystal or gems. Already the creation of a gem huge enough to create a golem, let alone its modelling, is beyond the grasp of ordinary sorcery. Giant crystals are more common. However, the stability of such crystal formations is often lower than desired, and often, tremendous effort is wasted only to learn that the crystal was flawed from the beginning.\nOther variants of elemental golems are speculated about, but yet, there is no solid proof about their existence. Given the scientific knowledge about problems that would have to be overcome, their existence is more than questionable."

        "text": "Your Golem and You Volume 1\nScientists distinguish between two kinds of golems: elemental and necromantic. Elemental golems consist of primal elements and are magically that condensed that a elemental consciousness is formed. That way a quasi-elemental is created, sharing several characteristics with true elementals. In the process of their creation, such artificial elementals only possess a rudimentary consciousness. Sometimes, if the concentration of elements is not sufficient and no consciousness is created, it leaves the creator with nothing than an empty hull and a burned-out elemental core. Even if activated successfully, a careless ritual might leave the golem flawed, which sooner or later leads to a similar burnout of the core. A flawless golem will exist for many years, probably outliving its creator by far. This might not be desirable, though, as a golem's consciousness might grow over the years, giving him a certain sense of intelligence and unwanted individuality.\nEven though in theory all elements qualify to 'spark' the necessary consciousness in a golem, their physical restrictions make certain materials more suitable than others. It is almost impossible to form a body out of air or fire that exists long enough to have the correct enchantments placed upon. Further, the lack of a physical body makes the magic charging of the hull next to impossible. Technically, air and fire golems are beyond the grasp of mortal sorcery. I only include these possibilities of golem creation because we knew it has been done under certain conditions and by gifted individuals or groups with tremendous resources.\nWater golems are similarly difficult to create, though this can be compensated by freezing water and giving it a solid form. Ice golems can be created, enchanted and manipulated by the usual rituals. The drawback is that a a thawing water elemental's core is subject to destabilisation and water, or better, ice golems are only of limited use. The climate to sustain ice golems is usually that uninhabitable to its creator that the effort of their creation is questionable, particularly considering the fact that there are golems made of more reliable material available."

        "text": "The Art of the Technomancers Volume 2\nBoth kinds of technomancers work on inventions and improvements. It is usual practice to built something to prove it can be done without any regards to applicability. For instance the technomancer Sileas built a fully functional artificial arm - which was 30 metres long and had a service tunnel for repairs and adjustments.\nLater, efforts are made to improve the own work or that of a predecessor. With the patience of a dwarf that spans his whole long lifetime and even longer, they work on a project as long as it takes to finish it. The former mentioned Sileas commented on his finished gigantic arm that it might take only somewhat over 1000 years until an arm might be constructed that could be used as a prosthesis. The whole technomancy circles around inventions and improvements. Most technomancers concentrate on a single project. This is not necessarily part of the technomancy per se, but probably rather a product of the dwarven nature. Though technomancy has established a lot of formal rules that should ensure the safety of the technomancers and their surroundings, it is not uncommon that technomancers get injured by testing their machines. Aged technomancers often have lost limbs, their hearing or even their eyesight to their experiments. Astonishingly enough, death is a rare occurrence among these accidents which might proof that the traditional safety measures are elaborated enough to prevent the worst. Still, other dwarfs who are not exposed to risks in their own professions usually see the injuries of technomancers as sign of their carelessness which is only a prejudice given the existence of the technomancers' code.\nAs it is common that an invention is worked on over several generations, technomancers gladly share their knowledge among their own people. However, they are more than reserved when it comes to share this knowledge with an outsider. Only a few secrets are actually considered off-limits to outsiders due to some secrecy code, but most technomancers are unwilling to share even the most basic knowledge. It is assumed that this behaviour results from the fact that technomancers had to become outsiders of their society to learn these secrets, so they are not willing to simply share their hard-earned knowledge. Another reason for this secrecy is based on the fact that most technomancers consider even the most complete and polished invention as just not ready to be released to the public. No proud dwarf would ever share an invention with the public that is not absolutely flawless. Others again fear, and with good reason, the harm that could be done if their knowledge would get into the wrong hands and for this reason refuse to share their knowledge."

        "text": "The Art of the Technomancers Volume 1\nWhile most dwarfs cling to the principle of earth or fire, some individuals break with this tradition and rather follow the principles of what they simply call 'the machine'. This breach with the traditions is a rare act in a society like that of the dwarven race that knows hardly and changes or surprises. One might argue this is the only way a dwarf can do something extraordinary and it might rely on dwarfs with comparatively rebellious mindsets, but all technomancers encountered seemed genuinely interested if not obsessed with their technomancy. It might be debatable if it is rather a religion or a philosophy, for most technomancers it is the only profession they pursue. Unlike other dwarfs that follow the paths of earth or fire, technomancers usually only pick a profession that is directly related to mechanics. Even a farmer that followed the ways of technomancy was known to apply all kinds of self-made machinery to his profession, but this, as previously stated, is a really rare occurrence. Technomancy is not overly popular in the dwarven society. Only a handful of technomancers exits and perhaps a good dozen of apprentices. Other dwarfs respect the technomancers, but usually think of them as at least a bit odd. On the other hand, the dwarven society welcomes technomantic inventions now and then. For the dwarfs the adaption of such new technology is a slow process and it takes often years of testing and getting used to the new tool until it is truly accepted by dwarven society. Some of the more extraordinary inventions never leave the workshops of the technomancers. In particular, inventions that seem to have no direct, practical use and a considerable advantage compared to 'the old ways' have a hard time to be accepted. This leads to two kinds of responses by the technomancers: some just give in and try to built just what the community is ready to accept. Those are usually the more sociable technomancers that sometimes have extensive contacts outside their own society. Others bury themselves deeper and deeper into technomantic knowledge becoming more and more strange over the years. Those technomancers are often far away from the usual thinking processes of a dwarf, as they only think in formulas and numbers. Sometimes their grasp of communication becomes so different that they cannot communicate with dwarfs anymore that are no technomancers."

        "text": "Mahatheb was the greatest vizier the city of Ankrahmun had ever seen. His counsel was prized and his wisdom legendary. He served the pharaoh Ashmunrah dutifully and faithfully. The wise Mahatheb had ever been wary of the studies of the pharaoh\u2019s dark son, Arkhotep. But Arkhothep whispered lies into the ears of the pharaoh and poisoned his mind and heart. In his wisdom, Mahatheb saw the futility of his attempts to destroy the mists of treachery that clouded the pharaoh\u2019s vision. Instead, he planned to help his liege in another way. Knowing that Arkhothep was using dark sorcery to gain power, he decided to gather more might himself in order to fight him. Being no sorcerer, the vizier looked to the powers of the legendary djinn, and studied ways to bind them to his will. After long research, he learned that even the djinn had to bow to someone who knew their true name. He pondered his options, when seemingly fate smiled upon him and provided him with an opportunity too good to pass it by. The well-known king of thieves, Qual'Jehari, had fallen in love with Xetharis, the beautiful daughter of the vizier. When he asked for her hand in marriage, Mahatheb presented him with a condition: to steal the true names of the djinn and give them to him. Qual'Jehari, love-stricken and blinded by arrogance, accepted without hesitation. He left the court at once, promising to return soon. Years passed, and the thief was not seen or heard again, while the vile Arkhotep grew in power and assembled his co-conspirators. Running out of time and options, the vizier tried other ways to stop the pharaoh\u2019s son, but to no avail. When Mahatheb was desperate and almost ready for a deed of desperation, a ragged pauper appeared in his chambers. The vizier was about to call the guards when the pauper revealed himself to be no other than Qual'Jehari. He was gaunt and marked by his quest, having lost both his eyes and his youth. With shaking hands he presented Mahatheb some scrolls of paper that had the names of numerous djinn written upon them. But the vizier\u2019s joy was cut short when he recognised that in truth only a tiny fraction of all the djinn names had been acquired. In his anger he had the thief flogged and thrown out on the streets. He studied the names of the djinn he had acquired and wondered how to put them to best use. But luck is a treacherous lover, and it had already betrayed the good Mahatheb. The thief had withheld one of the djinn names, and used that djinn to steal the beloved daughter of Mahatheb. This caused so much attention that the evil Arkhothep became aware of the vizier\u2019s actions and put his own plans into motion. Mahatheb however was wise enough to see the threat coming, and used the powers of the djinn to flee Ankrahmun, to a foreign land, taking all of his servants and riches with him. But he had underestimated the great heights of power that Arkhothep had already climbed to. The vile prince used his sorcerous might to cast a death curse on him, and all the might of Mahatheb\u2019s bound djinn was not powerful enough to protect him. All he could do was to prolong the inevitable. He used his remaining might not to build himself a palace as he had intended, but a tomb in which he planned to endure the passing of time until the one day he would rise again. His djinn erected the tomb, and Mahatheb was embalmed by his servants, who were then put to death by the djinn so they could join their master in the afterlife. Only I, his chronicler, was allowed to live a little longer to tell his tale. When this book is finished, I too will drink the poisoned wine that the guarding djinn will serve me to fulfil my destiny. May we all one days rise again by the power of the wise Mahatheb."

A spacious subterranean building, whose purpose is unknown nowadays. It was incidentally rediscovered a few years back when one of the village children got lost in the tunnels underneath the island, and found the temple ruins. We made some inquiries in the libraries of Edron, Thais and Carlin and found out the following: once this site bore the Name \"Moonshadow Temple\". It served as a place where, through crevices and by wisely arranged mirrors, the full moon's rays were conducted deep into earth's interior. Whether they served magical or cultic purposes down there or whether the full moon itself was an object of worship, is no longer known. Built of black granite and partly of white marble, the temple is of considerable size. Lately, since the were-sickness plagues Grimvale, the were-creatures have withdrawn to the tunnels and constantly descend down to the old ruins. At the times of the full moon they come up to the surface to haunt men; but more often they dwell inside the old temple ruins. Whether their interest in this site arises from its connection with the full moon or has different reasons remains a secret for now."

        "text": "About Were-Transformation\nScholars call it the were-sickness or the Curse of the Full Moon - but whether it is a disease or a curse is still unclear. Some claim it is similar to a contagious malady; others take the view that it is a curse in the classical magical sense. But about one question, the sages are in agreement: the taint is caused by a bite or a scratch of a were-creature. Were-creatures are humans who transform into savage beasts, mainly at times of the full moon. These humans assume the forms of wolves, for example, and may look like common wolves or like a cross between wolf and man. As long as the moon is not full, they seem to be normal humans, and act in a completely ordinary way. But in the light of the full moon, they show their true face. At an advanced stage however, the transformation may take place at other times as well. There are also other forms that afflicted humans assume: bears, boars, foxes, badgers or weasels, depending on an area's wildlife. There are even tales that in other parts of this world, humans assume the forms of local carnivores there, such as lions, tigers, panthers or even crocodiles. Besides humans, elves, dwarves and orcs can also be affected by the were-transformation. So, in short, the following traits are typical of the were-transformation:\n1. The transformation into a wild, at least partly carnivorous, animal. The person assumes either a common animal's form or appears as a cross between animal and man.\n2. The transformation is caused by a were-creature's bite or scratch.\n3. The first transformation takes place at the time of the full moon. During the transformation, the affected have no control over themselves and turn into ferocious beasts. In this stage, they attack even their own relatives, though no other were-creatures. However, espacially strong-willed individuals may resist this gruesome urge at first.\n4. If persons are affected by the sickness or curse for a longer time, they are able to transform themselves beyond the times of the full moon.\n5. In the early stage, the were-transformation is curable and reversible by a very rare plant, the purple nightshade. It is said that it blossoms only at full moon in subterranean tunnels where the moon rays are falling through fissures in the surface.\n6. To weaken a powerful were-creature, silvered traps are very useful. Liquid silver is needed to create such a trap, but this rare metal may only be found underground and at full moon."

They considered him as a tool that could easily be manipulated. Moreover, it was unlikely that he would intervene in their schemes. The land was full of corruption and intrigues. Several of the ruling families were feuding each other for reasons that had been forgotten in the course of time. The great snake looked at its people with disgust as they had stopped worshipping it for the benefit of gaining profit in the mortal world. The great snake was displeased and so it let a drop of poison from its right fang fall down on the land. Just like a plague, the poison killed half of the population to teach them humility. But greed and treachery had deep roots in the civilisation, and despite the priests' warnings and prophecies, those in power continued their heathen ways, and even tried to use the punishment of the great snake to their own advantage against their enemies. And the great snake hissed in anger. And its hiss stirred the minds of the lesser creatures, and so all the soft skins and horned ones grew anxious and drew their weapons. Like a flood, this horde swarmed the lands of the lizards, killing thousands of those who had survived the plague. Instead of listening to the priests of the great snake, the lizards forgot their noble heritage and hid in fear in their cities, hoping that the ravaging horde would devastate another city.\nThen the deceivers came from the north. They were only a few but full of spite and malice. They sensed the greed and treachery that now ruled all the lizard people and they saw that they had more in common than just scales. They saw an opportunity to exploit this weakness and fed upon the depravity of the society. So they maliciously decided to help the lizard people but only to lure them into enslavement. And all those blind lizards were so soaked with greed and lies that they they turned away from the great snake and began to worship the dragons. And the great snake turned its head from the lizard people of Zao and never looked back. The great snake abandoned the lizards just like the lizards had abandoned the great snake. But now some of the lizards felt a sudden emptiness and their fear grew. They felt that they had lost something vital and valuable. They suddenly saw their mistakes and the treachery of the dragons. They united to overthrow their reign. This rebellion was the last chance for the lizards to regain the favour of the great snake. This was the only chance of redemption. But after all those years of neglecting the great snake, they could not muster the faith needed to succeed. And so they failed. The vile dragons though would not allow another rebellion and bound all the lizards by dark magic to their will once and for all."

I know they had arrived in desperate times. Although some of them looked weary when they arrived from the north, they were powerful and majestic beasts indeed. I assume they are the survivors of some great catastrophe but they did not want to talk about that and nobody wanted to push them. With all the losses due to plague and war, their promises to lead us to victory over our enemies sounded too tempting to resist. Moreover, there was no other option left. Which each victory their support amongst the people grew stronger. Tzuzak soon called for them and they nourished the king with favours like someone is feeding a pet snake with rats. Their influence over the court grew steadily and many of the officials were eager to please them to gain their favours as well. It became more and more obvious that the dragons had turned into the actual leaders. Some of us could no longer stand this situation. We gathered in secrecy to form an alliance against the dragons. Treachery is abound in this land, and we have to act now or all will be lost. We will strike this night at several key positions and hopefully not only cause considerable damage but also lead the people to oppose the remaining dragons. Tomorrow night I will know if our rebellion has been victorious."

It did not take long until most of the southern lands was lost to the barbarians. The army was dwindling and civil unrest growing. Even when finally the cure for the plague had been found, the barbarians advanced. Too much territory had already been lost, too many soldiers had fallen victim to the plague and the initial attacks. It seemed as if the plague had clouded the minds of our people. Instead of fighting the common enemy, certain elements conspired against the king and each other. Without unified resistance of our weakened forces, the end of civilisation seemed inevitable. But some lizardmen who no longer listened to the lies of the prophets who believed in false gods started to pray for salvation. And even though they were only a few, they were heard. Our saviours came from the north. They abandoned the paradise that they had ruled to save our kin. On mighty wings they came with the north wind. Their wrath was like fire, they crushed our opponents and sowed fear into their vile hearts. They gathered our troops and led them from victory to victory. They blessed the lizards of true heart and led those lost in the darkness of lies to the light of truth. Those who refused to see the truth were eradicated by cleansing fire. They healed the wounds of the land and the wounds in the heart of our people. They burned the curtain of lies that had prevented our people from seeing the truth for so long. When they saw that the realm was safe once again, they got ready to return to their godly realm of perfect harmony. But the lizard people desperately begged them to stay. They offered them the leadership over the whole nation as they knew they would be unable to rule and secure the realm without the help of the divine dragons. Reluctantly the mighty dragons accepted. They gave up their paradise to save our people and adopted us as their children. The mightiest of them all became the dragon emperor of our realm."

I worked many years as a scribe in the palace of King Tzuzak VII until I fell into disgrace due to an intrigue some higher officials played on each other. In retrospect I think it was for my best. Not only did I find a never known tranquillity and peace in my new life, but I also was spared by the great changes that turned the whole realm upside down. In my seclusion not only the plague passed me without causing any harm, I also missed the arrival and the rise of the dragon kings. Of course there were legends about dragons, but no one had seen any for the last few thousand years. Since their arrival a few years ago, I have only seen a few of them from afar but I can imagine the awe they are causing in each being that faces them. I heard only little about the changes that came along with them. I cannot say it is a bad thing that Tzuzak stepped back for a new ruler. For all I have heard, the dragon kings are not much worse than the bureaucrats that preceded them. What troubles me more is the change of the land that came along. Perhaps you need to be as old as me to notice this change. Each of the youngsters I made aware of some of the changes just shrugged them off. But I can see that they are there. I see that the fields yield less and less each year. Plants and animals grow in strange and unhealthy forms and colours. And it turns worse with every year. The source of this all seems to be somewhere in the north. I fear what the land will look like in a few decades. Alas, I won't be there to witness it."

We need to hurry up but within reason. What Oberon wants me to do is nothing short of superstition. I am to conduct ancient rites, rituals. Spells older than most things you see around you in this world today. I refused when I was asked to start rummaging in the entrails of a being I could not even classify. It seems they caught a type of lizard and want me to dissect it. Not to simply see its inner workings, no - to use its blood and bowels to conduct another ritual, a dark and spell directly drawing from blood and reeking of pure evil! No more. I know that our honourable order wants to find a cure to this and that Oberon can get quite 'persistent'. But this is just not what I was made for. I literally can't perform it, my hands are shaking and I am seeing the most vivid images of demons and devilish trickery. I handed my research over to the Preceptor, knowing that Lazare will handle this issue with utmost caution. May he be the better man. Oh I know I have have failed, my flesh is weak."

Of course this greedy bunch is complaining about the food rations, but it is not our intention to have fat and lazy subjects. When the regents see it fit, they might reward some of them with extra rations but usually we are rather forced to punish the peasants. The most common transgression is indeed the theft of food. Usually a whole village is punished for that as this will teach them to watch over their own kin more closely. Ungrateful as they are, the peasants often complain about the privileges they enjoyed in the past. It is indeed a sad thing that the regents of old lacked the responsibility to their position and did not work hard enough to further the riches of the realm but wasted resources on the ungrateful and greedy masses. The punishment for spreading such stories is a difficult thing since those who are guilty are mostly old and rather fragile. If they do not survive their well deserved whipping, the peasants are enraged and sometimes attack our officials. I therefore strongly suggest to relocate some of the funding of the army to local forces to keep a closer eye on imminent rebellions."

I even doubted some of their essential doctrines and I remember tales from the dawn of time that made no reference to a great snake at all. Yet, those priests might be our last hope to get rid of the new rulers. The priests did not like my independence in the past, though, and I am not sure if I am welcome in their ranks.

But I can sense the taint that is spreading, and the spirits of earth, water, and wind tell me about some presence that is poisoning the soil and the springs. I can feel it also when I am fully attuned to the land. The new regime does not like if people talk about such things, and I was removed from my position in the ministry of agriculture. My abilities made me a precious member of the order and I used to be influential and respected. And now they strip me off like an old skin. I don't understand what is happening and the spirits can offer me little help in this matter. I retreated to my old home, banned from the gardens I loved so much. The spirits are still with me but my lifetime achievement was taken away from me. I could have understood the decision if I had supported the resistance in the civil war in any way but I was never a politician and did not take part in that rebellion. What is wrong about warning people of something bad that is happening? The dragon kings can't see that as an act of rebellion or spread of unrest. I just want to help with all my power. Why would they want to keep such a blight a secret? Is it perhaps their fault in some way? I fear the worst. I have talked to several of my old friends about that issue and they just won't listen. Even the most open-minded seem to have changed since some time. It is almost as if they were replaced by someone else. All they say is 'the dragon kings want this ...', ' the dragon kings want that ...' as if that were the only thing that is of importance to them. Perhaps I was too reclusive, too absorbed with talking to the spirits, and I don't understand my fellow lizards anymore. But there is still hope. I was called to the court of one of the dragon kings. I will probably speak to one of his highest ranking followers. I guess they have heard about my concerns and will give me an opportunity to speak about my concerns. Surely they will finally recognise the importance of my observations. Perhaps I will regain my old position and will soon have access to the gardens again."

Would a civil war not only make us more vulnerable with no winner at all? I fully understand and share these views. Still, it is our only hope. If we bow to the dragons now, they will rule us once and for all. We have to act here and now. Yet, I am afraid not many will join us and the temptation to betray our cause for some better position in the hierarchy is a constant danger. Our best hope is to form a resistance in secret and then strike at the dragon kings at once. None of them shall survive and we have to avoid fighting other parts of the army.

There has not been any glorious battle for decades. Even though I fear that the reports of panicked peasants exaggerate the number of the orcs, there is still hope that they will be enough to give my soldiers some exercise. The captain of the local border patrol has remained silent for quite a while now. I assume he is still figuring out how to explain that he had let slip some of the orcs. I will not accept the decimation of his ranks due to the plague as an excuse. The plague is something we all have to deal with. It is even possible that one of my rivals has paid him for his inattention in the hope to disrupt my control of my province in these hard times.

Ironically the calling back of troops seems to have brought the plague into the fortresses. So the reinforcement actually turned into weakening the positions. When the emperor learns about this, I am sure some heads will roll. Without any force to restrict them, hordes of infected peasants flee their villages and spread the plague further. From all what I can tell, the plague has spread everywhere by now and even the fortresses are no longer safe. I think once the orcs retreat, we will have a big task of rebuilding at hand.

In fact in ancient texts I found a report of an occurrence some generations ago with almost identical symptoms. The plague of these times was only local. The village was put under quarantine and the best physicians and supplies were sent. Over the course of a month, the plague had passed through and from over 100 infected less then 20 had died. It seems the plague in our days was ignored by the authorities for quite a while. Later a local governor tried to cover up this mistake and kept the plague secret. To ensure that, he chose a rather aggressive approach and had the village burnt down with all its inhabitants. It seems that some of the villagers had escaped though and fled to relatives in neighbouring villages. As the word of the extermination of the village spread, many peasants fled their villages as soon as the first symptoms of the plague showed up. Still, it seems the plague is hitting the peasantry harder than it had in the past. I think I will have to investigate their living conditions to get a better insight."

        "text": "Excerpt from \"Deep Thoughts\", personal comments of Chronicler Lagatos to his unfinished work \"Encyclopedia Terra Subaqua\":\nBefore the oceans that formed on Tibia took the shape they hold today, the underwater world of Tibia was already a diverse, busy and sprawling place. Ruled by the one god of the deep: Qjell*, Deus Profundis. Guarded by three depth lords: Obujos, Defensor Profundis, Jaul, Protektor Profundis and Tanjis, Expeditus Profundis, he dwelled on the very bottom of the deepest ocean. (*These names have been repeated excessively in almost all of the few writings discovered of this old civilisation so far and were extracted as the names of the three main individuals around Qjell.)\nAlthough violent and often primitive in nature, these creatures of the deep are strangely interconnected and should be considered intelligent beings. They communicate and interact with each other on a higher level than most inhabitants of the Tibia oceans. However, each of their existences is mostly focused on specific tasks. As each Deepling has to play its role, the social structure of their society is clearly structured and layered in strict castes. From what is known through collected studies and vague interpretations of writings in the foreign language of higher Deeplings, higher castes suppress members of lower classes systematically. This is achieved by radical control of everyday life of lower Deeplings and strict classification. Besides fear and oppression, higher classes especially utilise limitations to reach these goals. Parts of the society will not be able to access specific religious sites, sacred writings or even habitats of higher members. It is not possible for the majority of Deeplings to acquire the knowledge necessary to breach their social status for their entire life. Members of the upper class hand-pick other Deeplings for their future role as they see fit. Effectively destroying their former social life, family ties and former duties. From what is known to this date, the selected members accept their fate for a \"greater good\" of which it is unknown whether it defines worshipping their God King Qjell or simply living in service for the upper castes. It is highly possible that this system of control is maintained to reduce the risk of riots and keep the general mood and morale at a manageable level. It is not known how old (or young) this civilisation was when they decided to \"reduce\" their society to cattle and shepherd, but it is possible that they found this to be the only form that guarantees survival of the race as a whole. So far this concept did not fail.\nLower castes consist of scouts, various kinds of warriors and simple workers. So far it is assumed that the main tasks of female Deeplings, while being valued very highly in all layers of Deepling society, focusses on creative or supportive tasks as well as their offspring. Though it is unknown whether there are specific roles for females in higher castes."

For centuries our world was shattered and occluded from light and warmth. Those born under a weak tide were abducted, captured, eaten by fiends of the void. The strongest would prevail, but their numbers were small. Our race was facing extinction before they were touched by even a single beam of light. It was in these darkest of nights and the deepest of depths that a Deepling would rise to face the unlight. It was Qjell who was the first, the one to stand against these vile odds. He lived as one of us, he suffered among us. He reached for the surface and brought the light, his gift, to undo the deeds of the wicked. To cleanse the deep and to wash our faces for we were to expect the twin suns. And he drove away the evil and was light incarnate. This was the time known as the First Coming. We shall await the Second Coming. And for we are given time on this world, we shall use it to erect walls and pillars, temples and towers, gardens and cities.

After their leaders were convinced that their future lied above sea level, more and more of them stopped maintaining the archives and tending for the books. With the Deeplings rallying for war, the great halls of the library were soon abandoned. The culture of these creatures is complex enough to produce a significant amount of literature. I have found several works about sea animals, food, architecture and even early philosophical theories. However, progression of the Deepling culture in this direction has long been abandoned in favour of war preparations or social oppression of lower castes."

Faltugios suggested to run the ship with full power but I decided it is better not to take even the slightest risk on our mission. I am still convinced that IT will not allow us that easily to continue with our plans. Admittedly, I am extremely nervous, but this is no surprise considering the circumstances. Our knowledge is a burden not easy to bear. Therefore I keep these notes, knowing I'll have to destroy them when the time has come. I'm a bit nervous but I'm also anxious to learn what we will be able to do for the best of the world. Time will tell.\n... A sea serpent has attacked our ship. Could it be IT's doing? Though the serpent was quite huge, it was no match for our ship's weaponry. Still, could IT know our power? Or the strength of IT's tools? Even if IT is not working consciously against our efforts, it might be an instinctive reflex like an animal that flicks flies. If it was an effort to stop us, it would mean that IT is aware of our movements. Could it be? We still know so little about this enemy, which ironically is also our only defence and hope. Faltugios should be glad that the circle spared him of the tainted knowledge. Of course he is not and blames me for holding back information. If he only knew what a gift his ignorance is.\n... Today we had to sink two Treluvian ships which attacked us. They still hold a grudge against us for not supplying them with weapons, but they really should have known better. Still, I felt uncomfortable ordering their destruction. On the other hand, knowing what I know, to bother about it is pointless. They'd be dead, one way or the other, anyway.\n... It is hard to let no word slip my lips by accident. They do not have to know what I know.  Actually they probably already know too much for their own good. Or the good of the world that is. I try to blend out my knowledge as good as I can. Can IT perhaps hear my thoughts about IT somehow? The thing is that we know that there is some kind of dependency. But knowing about it only makes things work. I get a headache just thinking about it or even trying not to think about it. \n... With the weather that bad and several people seasick, I finally get some rest from their constant demands.\n... The weather gets better and the demands and hidden accusations are already increasing again. I was not prepared for such a thing. I am accustomed to my own studies in loneliness and not to care for the needs of several spoilt and eccentric scientists. I wonder if I was a good choice for that position. But now I have no choice.\n... The closer we come to the isle, the more it becomes clear what a responsibility lies on me. Sometimes when I try to sleep, I can feel it like a stone on my breast. What if the others refuse to work if they do not learn more about our agenda? What if we run into unexpected complications? What if we find out, our project is going to be a failure? What if IT knows more about us and our world than we assume? There are so many things that need to be considered. Would a good leader be as nervous as I am?"

As ordered I will present them the version of the secret research facility for biological experiments. Of course they will see through the obvious ruse. The morale is not that good anyway, with this half-hearted excuse it will only get worse. I wonder if IT will use this to our disadvantage. IT might try to influence the behaviour of the team members and pit them against each other. We can only assume what IT has learnt about the psyche of the inhabitants of our world. But I should not allow myself to get distracted from the goal. 'If' and 'when' do not help here. Our only hope is the outcome of our mission - even though it means our annihilation.\n... The lack of comfort allows tensions to grow. I have to admit, I am glad when they fight each other and leave me alone for a while. When they come to me for a decision, though, and both parties want me to decide in their favour, things become complicated. I wish we could concentrate on our research instead. If only the base were ready.  \n... The worker golems have finally built a rudimentary base. Our priority is research and not comfort. There is still some unrest amongst the members of the expedition. They vent their anger about the obvious lie in complaints about the lack of comfort. Sometimes they slack in their work and are far too unenthusiastic in their researches. They are like spoilt children. I know they could do better but they are sabotaging our efforts by intentional laziness. I wish I could tell them. Then again I wish I would not know. What if IT uses the dissatisfaction of a researcher to sabotage our work? What if IT's agent is working right now while I am writings this? \n... Today the base was under attack. Not that this handful of sea dwellers posed a threat, but alone the fact that there was an attack at this remote isle makes me wonder if it was a coincidence or IT's work. I ordered to strengthen our defences and had some of the golems reconfigured for war purposes to boost our defence forces. That reminds me about the recent malfunctions of golems though. Although it is nothing extraordinary to have such a quota of malfunctions. I keep telling myself that such a rate is not unusual, not even in Yalahar and our golems here are working under less than optimal conditions. Yet, it might be that this subtlety is a trick of IT. Perhaps he is eroding our mission from many vantage points. All for itself might be of little interest and waved aside, but aren't that IT's fingerprints? Isn't that what we should expect from such an opponent? I will have to remain vigilant. I will register the slightest imperfections in our mission and analyse them thoroughly. I will not allow IT to triumph.\n... Several members of the expedition seem suspicious to me. Faltugios is the most vocal of them of course. He was criticising me right from the start and I wonder if he is an unwilling - or perhaps even a willing - tool of IT. Yes, perhaps some of them know more than they admit. It has been always our nature to be inquisitive and sceptical. What if one of them has learnt more than he was meant to know? What if he'd become tainted by the knowledge and perhaps was seduced with lies and promises? Well, I should probably not assume too much. Such things, though not unthinkable, have never occurred before. As far as we know, IT has no allies in this world, so my speculations regarding this are probably pointless. Yet, on the other hand, the responsibility for this expedition rests on my shoulders. So shouldn't I be prepared for the worst? However, I will have to improve the discipline somehow. I will grant privileges to some of the more cooperative ones and put restrictions on those who oppose me."

They have been consorts of Faltugios from the start and were causing more trouble than their research had helped us. Yet, the attack has proven we are in danger and I have called for reinforcements. Though the fish creatures were no match for our weapons and magic, our defence is too weak and we have too few capable fighters in the expedition team. Until the reinforcements arrive, I have to apply a more strict regime in the base. I can't allow my authority to be undermined. Our project is too important. After all, it is not some fancy research but the only hope for this world to survive. At least sort of. But I should not doubt our plan. This would only play in IT's hands for sure.\n... The attacks of the fishmen continue. The more we kill, the more they seem to call from the depths of the sea for their next attack. This can't be a coincidence anymore. It has to be IT's work. Nothing else makes any sense. Faltugios suggested to capture the creatures to try to communicate with them to learn their motivation. But this can't be allowed. If they do IT's bidding, they might know too much and their knowledge might taint the researchers. Also, regardless of their reasons, we cannot give in anyway. The first specimens are growing and show promise. We can't allow to be distracted.\n... The reinforcements still did not arrive. Actually, they were not even sent. I wonder what is happening in Yalahar. I heard about some quarrels in the circle and civil unrest. All foreigners are put under greater surveillance and the defences are strengthened against an attack that the circle can not specify to the masses. The tension in the city is growing and I fear that we might have to wait for reinforcements for quite a while. I have to issue stricter rules for the base, even if this will alienate some of the researchers even more. I'm sure the majority will understand that it is for the greater good.\n... No reinforcements and the attacks become more and more frequent. The situation is far from desperate but our efforts are  hampered so much that we have almost no progress. Distractions, distractions, always distractions. I hardly get any sleep with all this responsibility lying on my shoulders. Faltugios is a constant thorn in my side. All of his actions seem to aim at undermining my position. This can no longer be seen as a coincidence considering the things I know. He must be a, probably unknowing, pawn of IT. Regardless if he knows what he is doing or not, he is a threat that has to be eliminated for the best of all. It would be best if the fishmen got him.\n... Finally word arrived that a small military force will be sent to assist us. We had another casualty in the fight against the fishmen. Not to mention the golems we have lost or those who were left running only with rudimentary functions. Most of us are great in wielding magic but none of us has any prior experience in battle. Still, our equipment and magic is ridiculously overpowering those primitives. I knew we were powerful compared to other races but I did not truly understand it until I saw the hordes of fishmen perish at our meagre defences. What could we have done for our world? But our days are numbered. Our existence will come to an end and with the great cleansing we will allow the world a new beginning. This is what IT fears and this is why IT throws us these hindrances in our way. IT has minions, I am sure of that now. Faltugios is but one of them. The fishmen are others. Who knows who is working for IT?"

With them commander Traks and two scholars from the exalted college of magic arrived. This Traks seems to assume he is responsible for the base from now on but I cannot allow some clueless strongman to endanger our efforts with his ignorance. We need to get a definite decision from the circle in that matter. Given the unrest in Yalahar, it might take a while to hear from them. This might be another plot of IT to stop us, to stop ME! What if IT is aware of me, because I am aware of IT? That is the way it works, right? That is the whole idea behind the great cleansing. IT is probably aware of me and plots my demise!\n... I  knew it! Traks and Faltugios are becoming closer and closer every day. Although the attacks of the fishmen could be stopped and now our forces are pressing to the inland of the isle to route out the creatures, the knowledge that two of IT's pawns are operating right under my nose is an insult. I am responsible for this base. I am responsible for the experiments. I am responsible for the fate of the world!\n... IT is plotting. IT's minions are stalking me. The experiments finally make progress and show some promising results concerning all those disgusting creepers, but I know that IT is observing that, too, and IT is preparing to strike. Traks and Faltugios are avoiding me. My suspicions have long become a certainty. They are traitors of the world. It is my duty to stop them before they stop us. The unrest in Yalahar is growing. I am on my own. I wonder if there are contingency plans? Am I expendable? Is my project already deemed a failure due to the whisperings of IT? I cannot allow them to succeed. It is up to me to stop them. I alone can do it, stop them. I will save the world!\n... It is done! I locked up Faltugios and that stupid brute in a chamber and let some of the experimental specimens free. As expected the creatures perished, but they distracted this duo of traitors long enough to flood the room with gas. The others seem shocked by 'the accident'. If they only knew! If they only knew! But only I know it, know about IT. \n... What have I done? What if I was wrong? What if Faltugios and Traks were innocent. No, no, I was right. They were in liege with IT. Certainly even knowingly. But even if not, I had no choice. I have the responsibility. Only I know! This burden. It haunts me in my dreams. I hear their cries. Could I have stopped this from happening? Pointless. I have to do what I have to do. Everything else is pointless. Only the mission is important. If the mission succeeds, we'll be dead soon anyway. If not, we'll wish we were and the two should be grateful that I spared them this fate. I haven't done anything wrong. The lives of a few does not matter. They, no we, are dead already, but only I bear the burden to know this.\n... Can't sleep. Another night without sleep. At least it keeps the nightmares away. The scholars report that the fishmen seem to dwell in some caves on the isles. Though I fancy the idea to drown them in acid or something like that, it would require too much effort and resources. I hope they have been scared enough to stop their attacks. The blood toll they have paid is enormous. Yet, they did not stop. This should be prove enough that they are doing IT's work. Faltugios had some obscure theories about holy places and such. I know not much about this foolish religion stuff. We had abandoned the so-called gods for a good reason after all. I doubt, though, that they would be willing to sacrifice themselves for some imagined hex or charm. No, there must have been some power that forced them to die for IT. This is prove that IT's grasp on the world is growing and we have to stop IT."

        "text": "... It seems, the attacks of the fishmen have finally ceased. The blood toll has only to be high enough, so that even those primitives notice that they are no match for the power of the Yalahari. Enlightenment due to pain and suffering. I feel a bit sad that I have not learnt about these aspects earlier. Perhaps I could have convinced the circle to change their approach to spread enlightenment. There is so much I could have taught the world!\n... As the book of Dgjuna teaches us, I have put my new insights into good use. I use the war golems and some fishmen we have captured from the caves to improve our experiments. The idea is as simple as brilliant. The newly bred creatures are pitted against the fishmen or the war golems. If they fail, they are killed and fed to the other experiments. If they show at least some success, we try to improve them further. I will outsmart IT! My weapon will break IT's grasp on this world. I will send IT tumbling back into the abyss it came from. I will teach IT fear. Yet - am I truly safe? What if there are other conspirators around? The scholars could be some of them. They ask curious questions about the death of Traks. IT is probably whispering to them. IT tries to use them against me.\n... The scholars behave more and more suspicious. Sometimes I see them watching me. I know they talk about me. Of course I could be wrong. But why take the risk? They will die anyway as we all will. Why not getting rid of them? The project - it is more important than them. Their need is expended. I will take care that nothing stops me from rescuing the world. \n... Faltugios is alive!!! He sneaked into my room while I was sleeping and whispered something into my ears. I can't recall what. When I switched on the light, he was gone. Perhaps IT has saved him and granted him ghostly powers. Or was it his ghost? Has IT turned him into a ghost? I am so shaken, so tired. I don't understand. We have some apparatus that should prove effective against ghosts. Tomorrow, I will set some of them up.\n... The others are eyeing me suspiciously. I know I look tired and act nervously but perhaps they know what I have done. Perhaps the ghost of Faltugios talked to them. Or he is truly alive. I have activated some ghost traps but with no success. Still, I am sure I can see him sometimes just vanishing when I focus my sight on him. But regardless of these attacks on my resolve, we make some progress. We established six stable species of the creepers. Now we can begin to add the suitable traits to them as planned. Later we will breed those species together to a single new race. My creatures will become our final weapon.\n... I shouldn't have done this. Or I should have left as ... I don't know. Now I'm in it and can't get out. It is up to me to finish this experiment. Yalahar is in uproar. I think the knowledge is spreading somehow, making things only worse. I have spoken to Tjule of the circle and he claimed to have no knowledge at all about my mission. What is happening here? Is it not the will of the circle what we are doing here but the work of a splinter group? Whatever! The plan is right. It is our only hope. It doesn't matter who came up with the plan. The crawler army is the only way to stop IT once and for all."

        "text": "... The creatures are growing stronger and stronger. Finally we see some success. Still, we are far from a breakthrough. To achieve our goal, the crawlers have to become unstoppable. Though we breed them to sustain themselves with almost any matter available and gave them a reproduction rate that pales those of any known crawlers, the rate of reproduction will not be sufficient to endure the final battle. And though they are more resilient and stronger as it should be physically possible, they are still not the ultimate tool they were meant to be. It will require some hard work and effort to improve them further. If I could only concentrate better. But they are haunting me. It is not only him but also others. Or is it him taking other forms? Some faces of my past, some faces I don't even know. I see them in the corners of my eye, only to vanish when I look at them.\n... They are after me. The ghosts and the others. I sent the scholars into the fish caves again and again but they do not die. They even brought me a living fishman as I requested. Now I have this creature here in my laboratory and it seems, it is eyeing me, too. Does it know it is only the pawn of a power it can't nor shouldn't comprehend? But strangely enough, his presence seems to keep the ghosts away. Or does it only distract me from the ghosts? Could it be that it was only my imagination that played tricks on me? No, I am too tired for these \u201cifs\u201d and \u201cwhens\u201d. I have to stay focused on my tasks. The breeding goes fine, yet, the creatures lack the desired abilities. We have set some of them free on the isle to see how they can cope with the environment. \n... Our creatures do quite well in the wilderness. Some of the researchers suggested to breed some additional traits into the creatures. At least I think they did. It is hard for me to concentrate these days. All the stress, the strain, never some peace, no solace. I am talking to the fish-thing in the cage quite often as if it could understand me. It curiously watches me while I am experimenting with the magic of the chrimaerogizer. I find it amusing how the thing sometimes mimics my gestures and even moves it's lips as if it could speak. Or should I rate this as creepy? The thing that does not understand me has become my only confidant. When I am amongst others, I usually lose track of what they are telling me and I start to see things. Faces, people, suspicious shadows. It has to be my tiredness. It must be. There are no ghosts that could have escaped my traps. I must try to sleep more.\n... The situation in Yalahar seems chaotic. I can't talk to any of the higher ranking members of the circle or the Jagadah. The only ones I can reach are clueless foreign henchmen. It seems they recruited a lot of them since we have left. The others want to leave and look after their families and friends. The scholars are heavy supporters of this idea. Why can't they just die? As if there weren't enough trouble and problems already. We are so close to another breakthrough. Just recently one of the researchers bred an astonishing new ability into the crawlers. Before, they were able to produce certain organic material. Now he added a trait that allows special workers to melt with the material and give it some living and perhaps sentient abilities. But if we stopped here and now, everything would be lost. The perfect tool for the plan is so close. I cannot allow IT to triumph. IT tries to beat me and to stop the project. I know it all too well, I am IT's foremost enemy in the world. It is a battle between us. Between my resolve and IT's hunger."

Without anything that could know about IT, IT will lose its grasp on the world and the world will be free of IT's influence once and for all. It was our fault to have lured IT here and it will be our glory to defeat IT! Sacrifice is necessary, that is how the world works. Sacrifice. I will have to stop them from leaving, somehow. Yes, this is my task.\n... What have I done? The sabotage of the ship went horribly wrong. Instead of not working at all, the ship left the isle. I was desperate when I found out that my tinkering with the engine had not worked as planned, but I was horrified as the ship exploded shortly after it left. There were no survivors. But I had no choice. They forced me to do it. It was their fault, not mine. It is IT's fault. I will have my revenge. I will avenge those who died today! I will continue with the experiments. \n... Only two others decided to stay here with me to continue the experiments. But I think they are suspicious now after the accident. I will have to be very careful. The ghosts have returned in the night, now joined by those who died on the ship. They are accusing me, mocking me. I must continue, though. I must succeed or everything was in vain.\n... The experiments with the creatures have become more random, less planned. The others stick to the original plans, but with the lack of resources, I have to take chances. Perhaps we will randomly get an advance that would have cost us years of planed breeding. Experiments we see as failures are released into the wilderness. Hopefully this will keep the fishmen away. \n... We are short of food. I will have to rely on eating dead experiments. \n... Rehus was attacked and killed by one of his experiments today. My only concern upon learning this was that he might join the ghosts that haunt me. The captured fishmen seems to be mocking me, too. I know what he is thinking. He thinks that my experiments will fail, that I have been unsuitable to lead such an expedition at all. He seems motionless and untouched when I yell at him, but I know he is snickering when I leave.\n... Failure after failure.\n... No one here to take care of the machines. No one here.\n... Tired. So tired. No idea what Hiona is doing. We rarely speak. I wish she had left with the others. No word from Yalahar. The others. They are dead, aren't they? Something with the ship."

        "text": "My memoires as dictated by the First Dragon:\nWhen I arrived in the lands of the scaleless, I already had a life of adventures and excitement behind me and so I was looking for a cosy play to stay. Eventually I found a little cave that had just the right size to serve as a small but decent hoard. Also the cave's acoustic would enhance the screams of my victims in a most pleasing way. Young dragons usually prefer a volcanic and hot environment. At my age, however, the heat is relatively harmful for my scales and the sulphuric fumes may lead to spontaneous stomach combustions. The new cave, though, had all the gloom and dankness an old dragon could wish for. Despite the cave's closeness to one of the few human towns that awakened in these days, the younger dragons had passed on because the town lacked a princess who could be kidnapped for amusement. Since I had no nerves for weeping, screaming and sad love stories anyway, the cave was the perfect choice for me, and quite a bargain, I might add.\nBeing a good neighbour, I refrained from burning and plundering the city. However, anyone who entered my lair was fair game of course. Oh and they came! At first there were only a few. The first ones were some farmers looking for a lost chicken. What an irony -  they tasted just the same. In my eagerness for a meal I have to admit I behaved like some newt. I had completely forgotten about my manners and let no one escape. Of course that way no one could spread the word and so it took a while until the next humans stumbled into my realm. Soon a healthy ritual established in which I pretended they had some chance to slay me - then I ate them, occasionally letting escape one.\nWhenever I recognised the flow of adventurers was waning, I invented a new vulnerability to give them some hope. In the years to come I pretended all kinds of things, something amusing like not being able to see through their laughable invisibility spells, something more desperate like pretending to be afraid of flowers or parcels, up to the absurd like acting that I was unable to walk through fire. My human admirers believed it all. They were all great sports and tasted quite well. The surprise on the face of those invisible sorcerers when I finally turned towards them to roast them for dinner -  just priceless. You must have been there to fully appreciate it.\nHowever, too much tin food, like we call those armour-clad humans, is not very healthy for a dragon in the long run. Yes, it's temptingly delicious and easily prepared but molten cheap metal does not go well with stomach acid. Moreover, we all know that one gets fat while being on a human diet.\nAnd fat I got and the stomach problems started. Also my hoard had grown so much that it did not fit into my humble lair anymore. Moreover, all the fights had lost their fun and turned into a tedious chore. So I made up my mind and started looking for a retirement home. A former pal of mine hinted me at an affordable island cave - that was just the place I was looking for.\nI felt bad for my humans, though. Whom should they feed all those pesky heroes to when I was gone? So I asked a dragon clan to move into my cave when I was gone. Only later I learnt that they did a very lousy job. One by one they got killed. Well, the damage was done and it did not really bother me much.\nSince then I've been living a life in peace on a strict no-human diet and I feel healthy and energetic to last for several more centuries."

At the peninsula's centre lies a large mountain range and one will always discover small oases and tombs scattered over the steppe. In addition, there are many rock formations, interveined with blue ore. This ore can be magically crafted into a rare and precious metal that Sapphire Blade members use for their blades. A large river, the Nykri, rises in the central mountains and forms a fork halfway to the sea. Here lies the big city Issavi, the heart of Kilmaresh. The original capital Nuur was destroyed by Suon's Wrath.\nKilmaresh has a warm, dry climate. The temperatures are very high, especially in summer, and it does not rain much. However, this part od the continent is not plagued by the lack of water that crusts the lakes and rivers of Krailos with salt. In addition to the river Nykri, there are oases in the steppe, which house smaller settlements or stations for travellers.\nKilmaresh is mainly populated by humans. They have lived on this continent for several millennia and developed into the high culture, which now forms the eponymous Empire Kilmaresh. In the past, numerous enslaved ogres lived in Kilmaresh, but since Suon's Wrath and the collapse of the old empire, the ogres are found almost exclusively on Krailos. A single tribe still lives north of the ruined city Nuur. In addition, the magical creatures who call themselves the Anuma  live in Kilmaresh since forever. These include sphinxes, manticores, lamassu and griffins."

        "text": "History of Kilmaresh\nA thousand years ago, a human civilization existed on the then still connected land mass of Krailos and Kilmaresh. They had built large cities, engaged in advanced seafaring and stood at a high scientific, arcane and cultural level. The people worshipped the two sun gods, Suon and Fafnar, and attached great importance to the fact that the worship of both deities was always in balance. However, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until this sect postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a civil war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by a major natural disaster that split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the land mass. This event was seen as a demonstration of divine wrath. It was believed that Suon had shattered the continent in his anger about the humans' misdeeds. From that day on, the old empire was in shambles and split in half. While the ogres revolted on Krailos, slew their former masters and destroyed the entire human culture, the empire's remains could be preserved on Kilmaresh and a second, new empire was established. However, this was not achieved by humans, but by the Anuma. The magical beings had lived on Kilmaresh much longer than the humans, but had been very withdrawn and barely maintained contact with the ancient empire. After Suon's Wrath they freed the enslaved ogres and took most of them to Krailos. Then they took control of the new empire and established several laws (carved into a large obelisk) that all humans had to comply with. A wise sphinx, lamassu or gryphon has been taking on the role of empress or emperor ever since. However, the Anuma administrate the realm rather than ruling it.\nAfter the great catastrophe, henceforth just known as \"Suon's Wrath\", Fafnar's worship was banned and prohibited. However, there was still no unity among the humans of Kilmaresh. Some now demanded the sole worship of Suon, while others insisted that there must always be a divine duality. This group believed that the worship of Suon and Fafnar, based on the tradition of the Genesis, had been a delusion from the start as Suon had cast his wild sister out. Instead, they regarded the sea goddess Bastesh as his true, new sister, because Suon had once protected her from Fafnar's jealousy. New religious fights impended due to this question - however, the Anuma intervened immediately. They decreed that both - the sole worship of Suon or Bastesh as well as the worship of both gods together - should be allowed. Only the worship of Fafnar remained prohibited. Nonetheless, a Fafnar cult outlasted in the hiding and is hoping for the return of the Wild Sun for centuries."

        "text": "Faith and Religion in Kilmaresh\nFor the people of Kilmaresh, the faith in Suon, Bastesh or both plays an important role in their lives. On the other hand, there are human groups that orientate themselves strongly by the Anuma. They form circles and groups that are often led by a sphinx or lamassu and the human members adopt the Anuma's world view and customs.\nThere is some friction between the group, which calls for the sole worship of Suon and those who worship Suon and Bastesh (as his new sister) as a duality. Additionally, there is also the forbidden worship of Fafnar which flourishes in obscurity. Some of the Anuma rather support the sole Suon cult, fearing that a new duality might lead to war again. However, they tolerate the Suon / Bastesh cult, but watch closely what they do. Yet other Anuma actively support the worship of Suon and Bastesh."

In addition to the smaller, mostly two- or three-story, residential buildings, there are magnificent temples, palaces and government buildings, five to six stories high and built up in stages. One of the cityscape's defining features are the colors red and blue: decorations in the form of tiles, mosaics or frescos predominantly have these two colors. Red / orange represents the sun god Suon and blue the sea goddess Bastesh, both of them worshipped in Kilmaresh. Statues of these two deities can be found in many parts of the city, as well as portraits of sphinxes, manticores, lamassu and gryphons. Sun and wave motifs are the dominant theme in ornamentation. The banks of the river Nykri are paved with massive stone blocks and there is a lively ship traffic. The city has a large marketplace as well as smaller shops on the ground floor of some houses. Overall, Issavi is prosperous, lively, clean and imposing."

Her followers go to great lengths to strengthen Fafnar's influence and try to re-establish her worship. To achieve their goals they are not above using either infiltration or violence. The Burning Gladiators are a special part of the the Wild Sun's cult. They are fierce warriors who seek to enforce Fafnar's will with a vengeance. If necessary they also protect the Priestesses of the Wild Sun on their rather subtle missions.\nThe Priestesses of the Wild Sun are a special branch of Fafnar's clerics. They serve the Smiter with great devotion but other than the Burning Gladiators they seek to restore Fafnar's worship by intrigues and scheming rather than brute force."

They have an ancient and lasting rivalry with the gryphons for reasons that are unknown to most mortals. The sages of Kilmaresh are researching this question for centuries but by now every story is just mere speculation. The best theory is that the manticores, favourite Anuma of the sun goddess Fafnar, hate the gryphons as they are Suon's favourite children. When Suon cast his wild sister out, the manticores accepted his sentence as all Anuma did, but bear a grudge against the gryphons ever since.\nManticores roam the vast steppes of Kilmaresh, hunting for prey and defending their territories. Interestingly, they are able to interbreed with common lions. The progeny of such a mating is a special kind of very strong lions with poisonous fangs but they are rarely encountered."

To get the rare egg shells, chosen members of a temple will undertake a pilgrimage to the gryphon nests high in the Kilmaresh mountains. If they find a pair that recently hatched fledglings, they will offer presents to the parents and ask for the leftover egg shells. Mostly the gryphons benevolently agree and gift their now empty eggs to the human priests. The mortals will bring the egg shells to the respective temple, where the eggs are blessed, gilded on the inside and filled with onyx sand.

They prey on insects, smaller lizards, snakes, birds, mammals and also humans if they have the chance to do so. But they are also eaters of carrion and thus attracted to rotting meat. There's a debate whether goannas are venomous or not. It is a fact that goanna bites cause incessant bleeding and many sages assume that this is because of toxin-producing glands in the lizards' mouth."

To the Northwest lie Carlin, a place inhabited by humans who struggled for survival on their own and could not help the dwarves in this matter either.

The shamans develop this ability to such an extent, that they can sense the innermost potential of newborn orc whelps. All newborn are tested and the shamans decide a future function in orcish society. The whelps are fed differently, raised differently, and educated differently. Wise men of other races say that such behavior is similar to some insects, such as bees, and through their empathetic bond might share a kind of 'hive-mind', so they refer to orc communities as hives. The chief of a hive owns a big harem of women who have no other function than to pleasure him and give birth to new orcs. These orcish matrons are usually incredibly big and fat, almost not able to walk on their own. Where 'normal' orcwomen function as laborer and craftwomen and give birth to two to three orcs in their lives, these female orcs are only reproductive machinery, giving birth to about six whelps each half year. Orcs are usually contend with their place in orcish society and only the leaders fight each other on purpose. Rarely will an orc raise a weapon against another orc, even if they are not of the same hive. Rivalry between hives is usually dissolved through a fight of their leaders and the victorious hive absorbs the other one. Now and then, when a new strong warrior reaches maturity he challenges the old leader for a fight of supremacy. Sometimes though, when the hive becomes too big for the area it occupies, such a warrior senses somehow that its time to move on. Then he and a few other orcs leave the hive in peace to settle somewhere else. This unique culture, together with its fertility, makes the orcs the most formidable threat to all other tibian communities."

Pour the slime into a cold cauldron and add in the other ingrediants into the cauldron and boil it. This seems to be the base of a powerful potion, though the finalization and the spells needed to enchant it are still a riddle to be solved."

The dwarves reacted quick and by valor and superior equipment defeated the raiders. This ensued the War of Welcome. After this incident the dwarves who claimed that the time had come to stand up for their beliefs and their treasure got the proof they needed to convince their brethren and sisters of their cause.  The orcs would not retreat though and prepared themselfes for war. After a year of battle the orcs were finaly crushed and the tribe scattered. The dwarves now again claimed dominance over the heart of the continent and all the land that 'where under the shadow of the big old one'. The humans of the thaian kingdom became allys to the dwarfen empires soon after theese wars and trade flourished."

You need to accumulate some critical mass of synergistic energy and open a rift between the worlds. The needed ingredients consist of some of the negative energy that is similar to the essence of the demonic realm.\nThe first part of the summoning ritual opens only a small rift to the demonic realm. Through this rift demonic energy enters into our world infiltrating into the ingredients and filling them with more power. With stronger ingredients, the ritual opens a larger rift this time, letting more demonic energy in to strengthen the ingredients. This ritual is repeated over and over again until the ingredients are strong enough to open a portal through which the demons can pass.\nThis ritual can also be initiated from the demon side. Sightings of Orshabaal and similar entities clearly show all characteristics common for such rituals.\nOnce the gate is open, demonic minions appear and boost the negative energy of the place by their sheer presence. Later, the demonic master is following. His appearance causes a drop of the negative energy as the demon lord is feeding on it to sustain his existence in our realm.\nAs long as there are enough minions to boost the negative energy of a place, demons can exist for a very long time in our realm. So in theory, it would also be possible that the gate between the two realms is kept open, allowing more and more demons to enter our world that can easily form a demonic army causing mayhem and havoc.\nThe archdemon Shervad the Destroyer wore an armor made of an unknown material that allowed him to stay in our realm for at least three centuries. In his last battle, he lost his strength, even though he was not physically hurt - his enemies had destroyed his armor. It is said that the armor was made by some ore found in the old mines."

This magic changes appearance and personality slightly, allowing elven parents to give birth to 'wish-kids'. In their shared dreams the elven parents seem to sculpture their child like a piece of art. Though most of the dream magic of the past is long forgotten, this rudimentary magic seems to be natural to the elves. It is possible to 'choose' things like hair or eye color and even gender. Even slight changes of the physique are possible, though considerable changes take place in the span of generations. Wise men assume this ability was a 'gift' of the gods to make more adaptable tools for the elves' war. But the mentality of the elves did not allow them to form their children in a 'convenient' way. Since most of this magic is instinctual, they form their children in an aesthetic way. On the other hand, what is seen as aesthetic is based on the philosophy of the parents and so their background changes this view dramatically. This is even more evident in the castes that were separated in the war."

        "text": "The Dark Woman III\nStumbling out of the mausoleum, he found himself in the ruins of a once-proud city. It did not take him long to realise that these ruins were the remnants of his own capital. It appeared that he had lain in an unholy slumber for a very long time. And now his kingdom was lost, run over by his enemies, and his former subjects were enslaved or dead.\nStunned with shock and disbelief, he wandered aimlessly through the ruins. To his own amazement, however, his heart did not race as furiously as might have been expected. In fact, it did not beat at all. Stricken by panic and confusion, the king went on and on until he came across a small group of travellers, who had sought refuge in the ruined city. The meeting was not a coincidence because he had felt their presence for quite some time and purposefully directed his steps towards them. In fact, all of a sudden a hunger had taken hold of him such as he had never experienced before. He rushed towards the strangers as fast as he could, his mind inexplicably clouded by this weird hunger. When he finally returned to his senses, the travellers lay dead before him, their bodies twisted and mutilated. He was confused and aggrieved to find that the only living beings he could have asked about what had happened were dead, but at the same time he felt strangely intoxicated by a feeling of mad triumphalism. The weird hunger that had troubled him was nearly gone and he felt stronger and more alive than he had ever done before. He fled the city that very night, running away from his painful memories. He made it his habit to travel only by night as he found that daylight caused him insufferable pain.\nToday, little is known of his fate or of what is driving the creature that once was a king. Some say the demon he devoured has taken control of this new form, while others claim that the accursed king is driven by guilt, looking for redemption from the sins he committed against his people, distorted though his vision of redemption might be. Yet another group of scholars claims that the accursed king is bent on revenge against the dark gods who plotted his downfall or perhaps against the gods of light who let him down in the hour of need. What is certain, though, is that he fathered many others like him who share his curse, and that he has lived longer than any mortal creature should, enduring the aeons and watching the ever changing world frozen forever in the moment of death that did not lead to true death."

That way, she managed to secretly drink his blood to sap away his strength. Having fallen out of the true gods' favour because of his sins and excesses, he had grown vulnerable to the darkness, and he could not free himself of the evil that had befallen him. With every day that final battle grew nearer and nearer the king grew weaker and weaker. And yet not all was lost. The king was still in his prime and his strong will, which was without equal among mortals, kept him going. For a while it looked as if he might be able to turn the tide and to lead his armies to victory even in his weakened state. It was then the accursed thing that posed as his loving wife made a fatal mistake. Having become desperate or perhaps simply overwhelmed by greed, she took too much of her husband's life force, revealing her dark nature at last. As the spell that lain upon him for so many years broke and the king awoke from his dark slumber, he surprised the thing he had thought to be his loving wife feeding on his very blood. In a heartbeat the veil of years of deception was torn, and the once-proud king saw the terror that had befallen him for what it was.\nHis despair knew no bounds. Blinded by feelings of rage and guilt, he slew the accursed creature that was neither demon nor man with a single mighty stroke. When he saw the unholy creature whom he had loved so desperately lying in her blood he sunk unhappily to the floor. He wept with sorrow and despair, while outside the drums were beaten and the trumpets of war were sounded. The generals came and tried to call him to battle, but he would not move. Tortured by feelings of remorse and guilt and hate and despair, his mind was close to madness for a long time. Eventually, an idea took hold of his mind that defied sanity. If his strength had been taken from him by stealing his blood, could he not get it back by drinking his accursed wife's blood? And laughing madly, he turned to drinking the dark blood that had poured from the shattered beast.\nAlas! His hope was in vain. The tainted blood weakened his body instead of making him stronger. Before he knew it, he had passed out. However, when he awoke, he seemed to be strangely invigorated. Feeling ten times stronger than he had ever felt in his life, he tried to get up, only to find that he was surrounded by complete darkness. The air was stale and cold, and not a sound was to be heard. Mustering up all his strength, he pushed against the low ceiling of his stony prison and managed to lift the lid. When his eyes had accustomed to the twilight he realised that he lay in a dusty mausoleum. Stunned and bewildered, the king rose. Everything around him was marked by time and decay."

        "text": "The Dark Woman I\nIn the olden days there lived a king that was unlike any other king amongst humankind before and after him, except for the divine Banor himself. His light shone upon his subjects and gave them enlightenment.\nThe dark gods looked at him in malice and hatred, but he was blessed and protected by the gods, and nobody could harm him. The dark gods were furious. They held council and discussed how the good king could be undone. Finally, they came up with a diabolical plan. They took a thousand mortal slaves as well as the most vile and cunning of their succubus demons and went to create an entirely new being. They created a woman and sent her into the realm of the great king. She was human by all appearance, but she was evil to the core.\nHer exquisite body and her soft voice were of unsurpassed beauty. She was met with rapture and admiration wherever she went, and many a man lost his heart merely by looking into her gentle eyes that seemed oh so innocent. Soon the king himself had heard of her breathtaking beauty. Intrigued, he summoned her to his court. Nobody was surprised when he fell for the graceful girl the minute he cast his eyes on her. Within a day he proposed to her, against his counsellors' better advice, and within a week the kind king had made the pale, dark-haired beauty his queen.\nThe king was madly in love. He soon accepted his newly-wed wife as his confidante, preferring her opinions over those of his former counsellors. At first it seemed that her advice was thoughtful and prudent, and so it came the good king relied more and more on his beautiful wife's opinion. He closed his eyes and ears to other people's good advice and blindly followed her evil counsel. Little did he realise that she purposefully taint his views of the world with darkness. Using honeyed words, she sowed the seed of distrust in his ear, until he started seeing enemies everywhere. He grew suspicious of his advisers, who dared to challenge his beloved wife's wisdom, and turned away from his former friends, who tried in vain to warn him of her wicked influence. In the end, he even started questioning the authority of the true gods themselves, blinded by his wife's promises of power and glory. She made him believe that the country needed a firm hand and a more determined, efficient rule, flattering his vanity by envisioning the immortal fame he could win as such a glorious king and warrior. The enthralled king followed her advice, not realising that he was about to lead his country into tyranny.\nHe became greedy and ambitious, extending his privileges wherever he felt it necessary. He grew more removed from subjects every day, indulging in feasts and orgies while his people suffered. While his armies struggled in futile, pointless wars he chose to stay behind, claiming that he owed it to his people remain alive rather than to risk his skin on the battlefield. In fact, he very much preferred to indulge in debauchery, surrounding himself with flatterers and sycophants, and there was no greater joy for him to impress emissaries from other countries with the splendour of his palace and, above all, the breathtaking beauty of his wife.\nHowever, the good life was not to last. The tides of war turned against his leaderless armies, which had never failed to win the day when he had lead them himself. After a series of disastrous defeats, a decisive battle became more and more inevitable, and the king finally realised the danger that he and his whole country faced. Remembering the man he used to be, he finally decided to lead his forces. The queen protested. She wailed and threatened and begged him on his knees, but for once he would not listen to her. For a last fleeting moment it looked like all was not lost for the good king and his realm."

It is said when enraged these dwarve's eyes grew in light that could be seen a towns distance away and they went into a bezerk frenzy killing all that opposed them. Loosing all control and compassion in that frenzy they became unbearable even to the fellowsships of the savage axes and the dragoneaters.

        "text": "Vampire Hunter's Handbook I\nThe vampire is a beast created by evil, a parasite that needs the blood of the living to sustain his own parody of life. It is also a plague that spreads quickly if not fought by adequate means.\nA vampire is no longer a living being. When turning into a vampire the soul of the former living being is destroyed and with it also its emotions and certain values. They are replaced by something evil and malignant. Where there was love, there is now desire; where there was valour, there is now cold-heartedness. Every positive aspect of life is transformed into a mockery, just like the whole vampire is a mockery of life.\nThe bite of a vampire is infectious. Sometimes, the now poisoned blood spreads through the body of the victim and raises it from the dead as a new vampire. This happens mostly when the vampire drains the victim slowly of it's blood.\nThere are cases in which a vampire visited its victim over several weeks or even months, slowly stealing their strength and leaving their evil stigma. Such victims raise much more likely as a vampire than victims that were robbed of there blood in a few minutes.\nA vampire depends on the blood of others. If a vampire is not able to drink blood on a regular basis, it will wither and dry out, until it finally crumbles into dust.\nVampires are nocturnal creatures. They fear the sunlight because it evaporates the tainted and stolen blood in their veins. Sunlight greatly accelerates the process which lets vampires dry out. Only a well-fed vampire is able to resist the sunlight for a while.\nThe senses of a vampire are sharpened similar to those of predatory beasts. Still, just like these beasts, it is possible to chase them with the appropriate skills. Garlic, for example, is able to overload a vampire's senses. For this reason, vampires avoid garlic whenever possible.\nVampires also seem to have a special bond to certain animals. Wolves, rats and bats are often found in the company of a vampire. They are even able to shapeshift in such an animal. As the transformation into a bat is the most common one among vampires, it is assumed that it is also the most natural one for them.\nOther animals, however, are rather scared by vampires. Horses sense vampires very easily and express great fear near a vampire's grave.\nEven though vampires usually keep their human appearance, they share the physical strength of other undead. By applying this strength more conscious than other undead they are even more powerful. Their unliving body is able to withstand a large amount of damage, depending on the amount of blood that they've consumed recently. The body rather soaks the damage than to repel it. This can probably be explained with vampires being rather shadows than true bodies, for the same reason they lack a mirror image. However, it is said that vampires can manipulate the mind of others, making them believe that they see a reflection.\nSome vampires are able to use this shadowy state of their body to become a cloud of darkness that is completely invulnerable to physical damage. However, all reports of using this special ability tell about very old vampires. It seems that vampires grow more and more powerful with each decade or century they live their undead lives."

In life they do many damnable things for their dark gods, burdening their souls to such an extent that they will most likely rise as ghosts if the dark gods do not claim their souls.\nIn some cases where the soul has been claimed, the hollow spirit still captured within the dead soulless body can utilise the dark energies of the corpse and animate it.\nJust as an undead being is controlled by a necromancer, the vampire is merely a shell controlled by the spirit residing within.\nThe spirit constantly needs to refresh the dark energy he is using up and is in dire need for a substitute for the soul. Additional special circumstances such as holy ground or sunlight amplify the rate in which the dark energies decrease. To substitute this, the vampire is forced to steal the souls of the living.\nThe easiest way for him to accomplish this is by stealing the blood of living humans. The blood normally contains some amount of soul energy, however, a vampire is able to force more soul energy into it's victims blood while feeding.\nIn his own dead shell the vampire transforms the stolen soul energy into new dark energy. This process keeps him in existence. Over the years, the entire body only consists of dark energy residue and slowly turns into a shadow with substance.\nIf the vampiric body is destroyed, the spirit within becomes entrapped in the remains. Helpless it is cursed to wait for enough dark energy to accumulate in order to be able to recreate the shadow body in some way. Given time and sacrifices, a vampire might slowly rise from the state of apparent destruction to once again haunt the mortals.\nAnother possibility is that the remains are close to some source of dark power, giving off enough pure dark energy to occasionally haunt the dreams of the living or to form a ghostly body to steal the life breath of sleepers in the vicinity of the vampires' corpse. This process might take longer but will still lead to the vampires' resurrection.\nThe only way to irrevocably destroy a vampire is a blessed stake. The stake will destroy the evil spirits' ties to our world and send it into hell screaming."

        "text": "I've been hunting vampires since the days your grandfather's grandfather was an infant. So you better listen to me, otherwise you might end up dead. Even if you listen to me, there is a good chance that those beasts will get you. I don't care why there are vampires and when they came here. The only thing that matters is that we will outlive them!\nDon't think about them in terms of beings. They're nothing than beasts, trust me. They are cunning and deceptive, but still beasts.\nDon't fall for their nonsense of being the rulers of the night. There is no dark curse, it was their own choice to become a vampire. They feed on humans because they are placing their own stinking existence above all else, and as I said, this was their own choice.\nVampires came to the mining colony in which I was living with my family. There were many of them, they were clever, they knew how to use magic, and they wielded dangerous weapons. My people had nothing. They killed some to still their thirst for blood, and many just for fun. We fought them in the tunnels, armed only with a few tools. At last we managed to let the tunnel collapse to kill the majority of us. This way they were at least no longer able to use us as source to satisfy their thirst for blood.\nIt was my curse to survive. It took me three days to dig myself out of the tunnel. Then I was found by the inquisitors that were chasing the vampires. I stayed with them for a while, accompanying them on their vampire hunts. But they were humans and their lives were short, so they attended other matters at some point. I left them and joined other hunters, and travelled the world.\nI have killed my share of vampires in all those years, some weak, some strong. I learnt to fight, I learnt to run, I learnt their weaknesses, and I learnt their strengths.\nWhenever you think you know all about a trade, you learn something new. If you fail to learn, you'll die. I've known many good people that died while hunting vampires. It took a few hundred years until I considered myself as quite good in this trade.\nThere is one weakness all vampires have in common: they're cowards. They proved this already when choosing the life of a vampire instead of facing the feared death. They prove this at each sundown when they rise again instead of ending their miserable existence. They prefer to spread their curse than to stop it. Selfishness is their main motive. Even though they form packs just like other beasts, they know no loyalty or support when danger arises.\nListen, I'm supposed to train you in the art of vampire hunting. But that's not how it works. If you are a fool, I cannot train you to be a genius. I suppose you know how to fight, else they would not have sent you. To learn the tricks of my trade, arm yourself with a blessed stake and hunt some vampires. Bring me their dust to prove your worthiness."

        "text": "The Origin of Vampires\nSince the vampiric curse is spread through infectious bites, many vampires know only little about the origin of their kind. Then again the longevity or even immortality of vampires makes it possible that they have even existed before the creation of mankind.\nOf course such beasts are hard to capture and they do not like to share their knowledge. Even if you are lucky enough to be able to talk to one, you cannot be sure if he is telling the truth. In fact, most questioned subjects were making up stories and boasted about their importance, age and accomplishments.\nLacking historical knowledge, such individuals can usually be cornered by accurate historical questions. This leaves a few sources that can be seen as credible to some extent. Still, their reports are diverse and share only a few facts. These common facts are the most reliable information we have these days.\nThe vampires claim that the eldest of their kin still remember a time when humankind was still divided in nomadic tribes that suffered in the wars of the gods. Some see this as a reference that the creation of the first vampires took place before the Corpse War.\nThe majority of vampires agreed that there was only one shrouded forefather vampire, though few mention also a small coven from which the vampire plague was initiated. The most reliable sources tell about some 'lost kingdom' where the first vampires ruled over a herd of humans that they treated like cattle.\nAt some point in history, the younger vampires rebelled against the elders who suppressed them. Others claim the rebellion took place to gain power in this static aristocracy in which the older vampires would have never made room for the next generation due to being near to immortal. It is unknown which side won. In fact the discrepancies in the single stories are so large that we assume that the vampires themselves are unsure about the happenings in these obviously chaotic days. Some claim the rebels won and chased the aristocracy away, others say the ruling cast won and met the rebels with such brute force that the few survivors could only flee. Then again there are stories that the fight between the vampires awakened something evil which drove the surviving combatants off their once safe haven. A few stories even claim that the humans used this opportunity to rebel against their cruel oppressors.\nThere are no hints about the location of this lost vampire kingdom. It is assumed that it was somewhere overseas, though. Some historians suggest Edron, but, the ruins in Edron are said to origin from much earlier times. Others assume it might have been on the mysterious continent Darama, either in Drefia or in Ankrahmun. However, the destruction of Drefia took place much later and there were no reports about undead activity, except for the works of several local necromancers, before this time. Ankrahmun, on the other hand, has a very accurate historical library and there is no such thing like a vampire kingdom mentioned at all."

        "text": "The Shadows of the Vampires\nThe vampire plague had its origin in mortals dabbling with the dark arts.\nIn the wake of the Corpse War, several humans began practising forms of necromancy for one reason or another.\nSome saw the seemingly overwhelming powers of the undead and desired them for themselves. Others desperately tried to discover some countermeasures for the undead threat.\nResearching for either good or evil, a small cabal of people studying necromancy became infected or cursed, slowly turning them into ghouls themselves. The change was slow enough for the necromancer fledglings to try to avert this change with any means possible. They came up with several methods, mostly based on alchemy. At long last they turned distilled human blood mixed with several forbidden ingredients of demonic origin into an effective potion. Not only did the potion end the rotting transformation, it also revitalised the drinker, making him feel healthier and stronger than ever before. It seemed to be an immediate success.\nAfter the entire cabal received the 'cure' it quickly became obvious that the success was only temporal at best. Soon they began feeling weak. Human food offered them nourishment no more. Again and again they were forced to revert to their potion. Trying desperately to find a permanent cure, they varied the original formula, to no avail.\nTwo of the brightest minds of the cabal finally joined efforts in their research, refusing to let others participate. This slowed them down in their experiments. At long last they came up with a theory that the blood of one of their 'kind' just might be the cure they need.\nInstead of carefully draining themselves and exchanging the blood, they started an argument over who should be the first to be cured. Soon the argument got out of hand, resulting in a fight about who had made the discovery and who deserved the praise. A fight of words turned into a fight of fists, one of them ended up dead and the unwilling donor of the much needed blood.\nThe survivor indeed felt cured, even better than before. He disclosed his research to his fellow necromancers, declaring the death of his colleague an accident. The others were too interested in the cure to truly care, eager to be cured themselves. Though blood was gathered and exchanged it did little to cease the transformation, let alone stop it. The 'cured' necromancer soon figured out the blood had to be taken from a living donor in such a mass and speed that the victim would surely die.\nSecretly he shared this knowledge with his most trusted brethren. They slew the others by night. After the initial shock the victims fought back. More than half of the cabal met its demise in this fight. Only few escaped, doomed to become nearly mindless ghouls.\nThe others learnt soon enough that the supposed cure only stabilised their semi-undead state in some way. Though no longer dependent on complicated alchemical potions, they knew that only the blood of the living would quench their thirst. Also, they were able to infect their victims with some strange strain of their own illness, making them the first true vampires with the attributes and vulnerabilities that are known to us today. It was not possible to recreate the original illness or curse that in combination with several not documented potions initially turned the cabal into unliving things."

He flattered her with compliments, and he succeeded in seducing her. Thus they conceived Brog, the fiery raging berserker. Brog possessed only little of his fathers wisdom, and the heat of his mother burned only deep inside of him. There however the fire became more ravaging and more hurting, and the rough titan raged and cried that the elements were shaken. Inexpressible pain troubled him, until the blocheaded Brog compacted his magical powers and hurled a major part of the fire far away from himself. From the fire, which did not want to cool down, however immediately the first dragon, called Garsharak, rose and he bore many further lower dragons in the course of the centuries from his fire and his magic, of the like we know today."

They wove a powerful spell, the spell of the creation, in order to bind Tibiasulas essence to the column of time. As Zathroth laughed loudly, in his vain triumph, he did not understand their words, and so the secret of creation and life stayed hidden from him forever.\nThey however wove the fleeting elements to powerful strands. Althought they did not succeed in uniting them again but the individual parts became something new, the first real creation. Thus the living part became Tibia, born from the element earth, Sula became the sea washing around it. Air rose over the creation and layed itself like a protecting blanket over the creation, and the fire seeped under it and began to warm it up.\nBehold: Each of the separate parts of the god was full of life and divinity! But none of the elements possessed the spirit of the Tibiasula, but they were wild and impetuous, following always the impulses which corresponded to their nature."

They even acquired some intelligence that improved from generation to generation. After a catastrophe that destroyed the whole island, only a few of those animals survived. Over the years, other animals added to these special creatures, and soon only a fraction of the animals still had the attributes of their ancestors.\nThese noble animals chose one of their kind as their king and with the knowledge of their ancestors they acquired immortality. Nowadays, those animal kings still live at remote places, though some of them might have left the isles for more hospitable areas.\nIf someone  succeeds in catching one of them, he might learn their secret of immortality along with other secrets that were thought to be lost with the destruction of the isle."

It is said that they allowed their owners to know whenever other ships where near and that storms and wind could be called with the blades to assist in the evil plots of the pirates.\nThe end came on the day these pirates decided to betray each other.\nIn a sea battle, they called for storms of such intensity that all of their ships sank. None of the pirates survived, and the blades vanished.\nIt is assumed they lie on the ocean floor."

This similarity to the behaviour of squirrels was never scientifically verified. However, since pirates love to dress lightly they also love the south. Therefore, it is only natural that they hide their treasures there. Some of the southern isles are so popular among pirates that there is hardly any free space left to bury new treasure.\nIf anyone ever is looking for treasures, then those isles are the best place to start with."

Although they can 'speak' like humans using some membranes, their native 'tongue' consists of a blinking code with each eye, where a blinking could mean some syllable, letter or word. It is by far the most complex speech we have ever encountered and it is almost impossible to comprehend. As far as we can tell it is not only a language but also some kind of mathematics. This combination makes it tedious even to try to understand that language.\nThe books the bonelords write contain only numbers and the code behind them is incredibly complex. This race was one of those which were part in the creation wars and therefore its peak of civilization and power is long gone. There are rumours about still existent bonelord settlements where they try to improve their unspeakable necromantic rituals and create an army of undead.\nIn general they seem malicious but without any ambition to do more than to claim some lairs and to defend them. They seem to have no ambitions in conquering or allying with other races in a bigger style other than bonelord mercenaries who occasionally join forces with other entities for private reasons."

They argue that the sheer concept of souls from 'beyond' entering our realm is by all means very random and could not be planned at all. They suggest that it's a lot more likely that the vortex was actually some damage that was caused to the fabric of reality. Through this hole in reality souls that were never meant to be entered our realm and, so they assume, it's additionally a leak that leaches away the power of the gods. They suggest that war for creation was NOT interrupted\nbecause the gods wanted to heal the wounds of the world, but because this powerleak frightened them that much. They further speculate that the withdrawel of the world was more an act of panic, an attempt not to lose complete control over\ncreation, and the process known as awakening is by no means the working of benevolence, but the gods losing grip of the things they tried to hide away from the intruding souls. The theory goes that as there is an ascension for the souls from beyond to achieve some form of godhood, there is a constant descent for the powers of the gods of old due to the power that is leaking away into nothingness and the power the living claim for their own. Of course this heresy is very popular in the ranks of certain ascension cults. More so since it takes care of the more common fear in those conclaves, that the jealous gods may strike back\non those who try the ascension."

He was superior to most of the liches and several of them had to follow his orders. In his early days, he enslaved the whole area of Drefia. He reigned supreme until a fraction of the liches tried to overthrow him. They were defeated and put to eternal torment as a warning to enemies and minions alike. Still the forces of Xemal Xoth were weakened and his ranks thinned out. Seizing that opportunity, a mighty circle of necromancers attacked Drefia and the lich had only a narrow escape. Seeking refuge in the pyramid city of Ankrahmun, he served under the Pharaoh and God-King Arkhothep as an advisor and court magician. But serving did not suit the taste of the vain lich and after some years he left the city to follow his own dark agenda. It was at this time when he secretly started to construct his lair. At first it served as a depot for the knowledge and treasures he had rescued from Drefia and acquired in Ankrahmun. Later he began to station his most powerful undead guardians and creations there. Still he was looking for some other centre for his power. A place where he would reign supreme once more. But by and by, his efforts concentrated on his secret lair with which for some unknown reason he became more and more obsessed with. He waged an half-hearted attempt to overrun Darashia with the aid of a handful of vampire lords and their minions. But after the tides of battle turned against them and seemed to favour the pious citizens of Darashia and the heroes that came to help, he abandoned Darashia without further thought. Several other incidents, involving undeads from all over the known world, can be traced back to Xemal Xoth but none of them seemed serious enough to pose a real threat. As the construction of his lair made further progress, he withdrew more and more from the world. So it is no wonder that his name has almost been forgotten today. The motives of Xemal Xoth can only be guessed, but they are certainly nothing good for the people of Tibia. Whatever he is concocting in his lair, it can only be hoped for that he is stopped before he succeeds in his evil plans.\nThe search for him, however, appears to be almost impossible since no living being seems to know where to find that secret lair. It can only be guessed that he learnt about some place of power and somehow keeps it under control. There are no real clues that can help us in this matter."

        "text": "The liberators of the spark by Sericos\nAlso known as liberators of light and several similar names this Banor sect is dedicated to the so called 'liberation of the godly spark' from the unworthy. In theory they agree upon the doctrine of the Banor cult that each human and probably some of the non-human races are born with a part of the divine essence in them. Whereas other cults are dedicated to make this spark flourish for the good of the individual or civilisation, the liberators argue that certain persons are not worthy of the godly spark and it is better to set the divine essence free by killing them in ritual combat. Certain splintergroups of the liberators go even further and claim that a person can claim the divine essence of those slain to strengthen themselves. So this heresy led to two equally dangerous and forbidden subsects of the banor cult. While the original heretics killed only criminals after their foundation, the term 'unworthy' soon became more widely defined, and they began to slay cowards and everyone they considered weak. The so-called 'new liberators' brought this heresy to another equally mad degree. They argue that if you can claim the divine spark of others by killing them you should not target the weak, but the mighty. They 'honor' their victims in duels and admittedly more then one new liberator met his well deserved end at the swordtip of an opponent far superior to him. Still there ARE a considerable number of new liberators around and doing their perverted work for their god. The church of Banor in turn has outlawed both heresies and affiliation with either of those sects is punished with lifelong laborcamp or execution."

It was our goal to reach the haunted ruins of Drefia using small boats that would allow us to stay close to the beach which had some major advantages: while exploring the coastline we could gather food and water in the jungle and avoid the dangers of the treacherous reefs of the northern coast at the same time.\nOf course this would still be a dangerous and daring enterprise - else it would have been done before -, but we were sure that it could be done. Indeed the voyage started smoothly. We grew accustomed to the difficulties of the coastline quite fast and none of the giant sea creatures that were rumoured to plague the reefs were sighted. The first actual threats we faced were quite ordinary beasts of the jungle which - although dangerous - did not turn out to be of greater danger than the animals we had encountered during other travels. However we did not expect at all the very jungle to turn against us. We were setting up camp on a clearing that seemed peaceful, even idyllic. With hindsight this fact should have alerted us, but we were exhausted from a lengthy trip and relieved to get some rest without having to drive some beasts away first. All of a sudden, thorns shot all over the clearing and the previously calm jungle ground came to violent life. Plants we had never seen before were biting our feet with the ferocious greed of a rabid hyaena. Complete disorientation and panic took over and there was yelling and running everywhere. When we finally made it back to the boats, most of the equipment we had carried with us was lost and there was no one among us who was not injured, some were even poisoned. We spent a hard night directly on the beach and woke up drenched, covered with sand and salt all over, our wounds burning like fire. Yet we decided to continue our expedition."

We reached an area where the reefs made it almost impossible to stay close to the shore and thus forced us to make a decision. We could either try to continue our voyage through the treacherous reefs by boat, or head for deeper water and travel across the dangerous ocean for an indefinite time or, as third alternative, continue by foot along the beach with the boats on our backs until it seemed safe enough to use the boats again. Under normal circumstances I would have opted for the latter, but me and my men were wounded and tired and the jungle had already shown us its ugly face in a way which made none of us want to see more of it. Heading for the ocean was no real option either. Not only that our small boats were not built for that kind of travel - reaching Drefia via the high seas had already been accomplished before and doing so would contradict the intention of the whole expedition. Thus we dared to stick to our original plan as closely as possibly and to try finding a path through the reefs. Shortly after we were rewarded for our bravery with a breathtaking sight."

Already half taken over by the all-devouring jungle vegetation but still clearly recognisable there was an actual city - ancient, but obviously populated. Having heard about the pyramids of the southern desert we instinctively related the jungle monuments to the same culture and to the people settling in the city of Ankrahmun. While we cautiously steered our boats closer to the beach and wondered about the mysterious origins of this jungle city, more and more apes showed up on the beach, yelling at us in threatening poses. Strangely enough, they were wearing various kinds of equipment - actually wearing it, not randomly strapped to the body like some mindless beast might have done. Due to the obvious hostility we stayed far enough from them to avoid the coconuts and stones they hurled in our direction. I was left solely with the option to examine the strange apes and the ruins through my spyglass and was able to spot different kinds of apes which wore sparse clothing and equipment such as weapons in a way that made clear they knew what they were doing. However some - if not most - equipment looked odd on them, as if made for creatures of a completely different build. A closer look at the ruins revealed that they were not as ruined as I had thought at first, in fact most were only overgrown by the jungle. The visible remains displayed impressive work and art. Oddly, most patterns on the walls showed serpents and lizards of some kind which for sure did not fit the hairy humanoids inhabiting the city. Then I saw the first statues. Although obviously damaged on purpose and turned into almost unrecognisable heaps of stone, some of them showed features of two legged, upright walking lizards complete with weaponry and other equipment. Instantly I remembered the stories of intelligent, yet savage lizard men which were rumoured to live somewhere in the deepest jungle."

Although a good mystery can fascinate me a lot more than most women I met in my life, I was responsible for this expedition and for my men which stopped me from changing our plans right there and then. Instead I started to make up a plan for a later expedition which would lead me to the area where the lizard people possibly could be found in order to learn more about them. Thus we left the strange pyramid city behind us for now and continued our passage through the reefs. Shortly after, we eventually made it and the shoreline became safe once again. We decided to take a break and set up camp, even more careful than usual, securing it with everything we had at our disposal since we needed some time to repair our boats and equipment as well as to heal our wounds. We camped there for two days and - thanks to the gods - had to face only minor nuisances. During the night the same jungle which could turn dangerously silent in the daytime became a symphony of screams, screeches and howls of creatures no one of us could even imagine. When the sun set, the sky seemed to explode with massive rain as if the gods were pouring down a whole ocean on us. Even with our full equipment we would have had a hard time to keep ourselves comfortable and with a significant amount of our stuff lost to the jungle, it was almost impossible to actually recover. As we took off for the sea again we were all glad to escape this green hell once more. We followed the shoreline to the next impassable reef formation, however, this time the reefs were close to the beach, so it was easy enough to find a way around while keeping the land in sight as well as avoiding the depths of the sea. Using my spyglass, a wooden structure blending almost perfectly with the jungle caught my attention. It reminded me of an enormous fortification of some sort, yet there seemed to be no defenders, just thickest jungle surrounding it."

It was about midnight when a roar of some sort interrupted the cacophony of the jungle, and then silence remained. The waves of the sea and their gentle lapping against our wooden boats were the only sounds still audible. From what I can tell, the cause of this roar must have been something we had never encountered before. We had seen and heard dragons, even the majestic dragon lords, but this had to be something which would dwarf even them. I am not ashamed to admit that my hands were trembling when I took my spyglass and searched the night for any sight of the creature we had just heard. Of course I did not really hope to actually spot something in this darkness, so again I was more than surprised when I indeed detected a shadow moving through the jungle. I hardly could have overlooked it since it towered even above the giant trees of the jungle. I was not able to see anything more of it than its rough shape, but for all that I saw I swear to the gods it was the shape of some brutish humanoid. No one of us felt prepared to investigate this mystery in that night, and as the sun rose once again we had already left the sandy part of the coastline and followed the jagged mountain range which seperated Drefia from the rest of the continent. Our destination was near."

When I speak of culture, I relate them only to primitive orcs and minotaurs of course. During our expeditions to the jungle we learned that they are hostile to humanity like most of the vile creatures of this new land. Their animosity also spreads to most other races we encountered here. They seem to be a warlike race, searching for conflicts and fights with each and everyone they encounter. Obviously this mindless aggression leaves little room to develop a culture like the human one, achieved due to a long history. It is unlikely those primitive brutes even know the very concept of history at all.\nThis leaves one to wonder who supplies them with their exotic weaponary and armor. Perhaps they are some minor race of a greater dark power that lurks in the deepest depths of the jungle. The magic I have seen performed by those lizards was far from impressive. They use a very limited variety of shamanistic tricks that are insignificantly more powerful than the powers those average orcish hive shamans hold.\nTo sum things up, the lizard people are another hostile race that might be seen as a hindrance for humankind but they do not pose a threat. On the other hand they are of no use to us and a timely elimination could only be helpful."

How can it be explained that several watchmen of expeditions have vanished over night while none of the people asleep in the camp was harmed? How is it possible that well armed and seasoned adventurers got lost in the jungle? Considering the expertise of some of the victims this jungle has taken, it would be highly ignorant to assume that a simple beast of some kind could be the source of their ultimate doom. In conclusion we have to assume that 'something' is out there. A malicious, unseen power. Never seen but often felt. Noticed only by the 'inner eye' but never actually seen. Everybody that has ever set foot in the jungle knows this eerie feeling of being watched and traced. Sometimes you can almost imagine the movements of something invisible in the bushes.\nAnd do all those glowing eyes in the darkness belong to animals? I don't think so."

        "text": "The Pyramids of the Apes Vol. 1\nHaving experienced the apes as a very primitive culture, the rumors and stories about them living in a pyramid city, not unlike that of the far away Ankrahmun, seemed unbelivable at first. On second thought though we have to admit that we have seen stranger things than this in our lovely world. But how could those primitive apes build a pyramid city like this? How could they aquire such heights of architecture while they can hardly wield a weapon and have only a remote grasp to the concept of clothing? The answer is quite obvious though.\nWe know that the pyramid architecture of Ankrahmun has been used for its spiritual value long before the reign of Arkhotep. We also know that Ankrahmun is a city of the dead. As a matter of fact it is also true that in Ankrahmun the wisdom of many ages has been gathered and philosophy and science prospered like nowhere else in this world. It is obvious that the pyramids are linked to death and to wisdom somehow. If you put two and two together, you can easily figure out that those pyramids act as a collector of spiritual energy and probably even literally as houses of the dead. Imagine a civilisation that could have conversations with its dead ancestors and draw from the enormous source of their wisdom! Would such a civilisation not prosper like that of Ankrahmun? For sure it would.\nBut how is this connected to the apes and their pyramids one might ask. The answer is simple: being the primitive beings they are, the apes are unable to build such structures but some spirits of the past with the wisdom of millennia might have that knowledge. We all know that a primitive mind can be easily controlled. So it would be easy for such a spirit to take over control of the simple mind of one or more apes and give them orders. Without knowing what they were doing such mind-controlled apes could have built this city of pyramids. Of course the apes would have no need for such a city, but surely the ghosts or spirits would like to call such a place their home."

        "text": "The Pyramids of the Apes Vol. 2\nAfter obtaining their base, the spirits must have stopped controlling the apes which resulted in random raids that are too well known by the inhabitants of Port Hope and that formed their opinion about those creatures. The lack of organisation and control in those attacks makes it obvious that there is no higher power behind them. It seems that the spirits have now left the pyramids since the rare reports we receive from that place, tell us that the once grand structures are now overgrown ruins. Would the spirits allow their home to decay in such a way? I would highly doubt that. There are only two explanations for this phenomenon. The first possibility is that the spirits have left our world. This would be reasonable if you assume that taking control over a living being costs some powers and might have drained all energy from the spirits. But wouldn't those pyramids cancel this effect? For sure they would. So another reason for the spirits' departure could be that the spirits gathered enough energy through the pyramids that allowed them to travel to another dimension or reach a new state of being (or death). So the spirits have no use of the pyramids anymore. The second theory for the spirits' disappearance is much more worrying: the spirits are only asleep. Perhaps the process of becoming one with the field energy of the pyramids was so exhausting that the spirits had to take some rest. If this is the case, they could wake up anytime. And nobody can foresee how they will react to us living intruders who could pose a dangerous threat to their spiritual home."

These ropes are especially useful when it comes to simple constructions that only have to last for a short period of time.\nThe jungle dweller bush is quite a common plant. It's the home of a variety of insects and small animals.\nThe green wig bush is mainly known for its long, threadlike roots. Although those roots are edible it is not advisable to actually do so. They have an extreme bitter taste and need to be boiled to reach an edible state. The green wig bush got his name from the sad fact that sometimes the murderous dworcs use its roots to bind them to their heads as some kind of camouflage during their sneak attacks.\nThe lizards tongue is quite an unremarkable plant. It grows quickly but there is no real use for this resource and it does not please the eye enough to be worth growing it. It can be easily recognised by the slimy coating of its leaves which partly led to its name.\nThe jungle crown is somewhat rare. Still it's quite an unremarkable plant considering its majestic name which probably originates from its unique ringlike growth pattern.\nIt is unknown if the name of the green fountain bush was chosen deliberately or rather accidentally, but the name is well to the point for two reasons. Firstly, it does indeed resemble a frozen green fountain and secondly, like a cactus it is able to accumulate a substantial supply of water in its thick leaves."

Probably the first explorers were shocked when they first saw the thick round blossoms of this giant flower. Obviously, those explorers knew little about dragons and even less about plants, naming it a tree.\nThe purple kiss bush is a plant that pleases the eye and the nose alike. Sadly it seems impossible to cultivate it yet and so we have to live with the fact that we will only meet its beauty by chance.\nThe jungle umbrella in its many varieties is extremly common and only the fertility of the other jungle plants prevents it from becoming a pest. It grows faster than bamboo but lacks its usefulness. Its wood is thin and breaks easily when dried.\nOn touch the chill nettle injects a very mild poison that let the skin feel somewhat numb and cold. Although some people try using it to fight the heat, it actually does not prevent overheating and also the production of sweat is not reduced. Given the threat of possible long-term damage, it's not advisable to use the nettle for this purpose.\nThe monkey tail plant is most likely related to the chill nettle. It is also possible that one plant is disguising the other one for some unknown reason. Before the monkey tail blooms, the two plants almost look alike. Only when the monkey tail reveals its purple blossom does the difference become obvious, even to an amateur.\nThe fairy queen is one of the most beautiful plants in the whole world. Unfortunately it needs an insane effort to grow them away from their natural habitat. To grow one, expensive supplies and a group of specialists are needed that only kings and queens could afford. Therefore, the fairy queen will only be found in company that fits her royal title."

Crane used to be a rather unremarkable student of mine who tended to overestimate his abilities and who flattered himself by giving this plant his name. Fittingly, the crane plant is a rather pompous plant.\nJungle bells are lovely, small plants that need much light and water. Still it is possible for a dedicated botanist to grow one or two of them if he really puts effort into it. Unfortunately, the jungle ants are as eager of this plant as the forementionend Malcom Crane was eager of some recognition.\nThe dawn singer is a plant that opens its blossom by the first sunbeam in the morning. Its blossom looks very close to an open mouth which probably led to its name. However, one might wonder if a less flattering name would have been more appropriate considering the awful odour that emanates from it in the morning hours.\nThe turtle sprouter can be cultivated quite easily since all it needs is much sun and warmth which can be easily provided in an environment like the jungle. It is somewhat more difficult to grow them in other regions although not impossible if mainly grown indoors. The name was derived from its sprouts that have the shape of small orbs.\nThe bees ballroom does not only attract bees but all kind of flying insects with its strange but not unpleasant odour. Usually you hear this plant before you actually see or smell it because there is a constant buzzing and humming of insects around it.\nThe jungle rose is a relative of our ordinary rose. Unlike the known roses, some plants of this species can reach impressive proportions while others do not exceed the size of an ordinary rose. It has not been discovered yet if this giant version is some subspecies or if its tremendous growth is influenced by other means."

I have no idea how long it takes until a plant reaches its full size which even dwarfs some trees. I have not been able to grow one to its full size yet, and I begin to wonder how old those full grown plants we encountered might have been.\nThe purple cardinal is a plant that looks very different from any other plant. It grows to enormous proportions and it is the only plant that jungle ants avoid in their ravenous hunger. If we could figure out how the plant protects itself, we might be able to use that knowledge to cultivate the area.\nThe witches cauldron is quite an eye-catcher. It is extremely big and has its own beauty. The traveller should be warned that it is not advisable to drink the rainwater that gathers in the big blossom. The plant seems to poison the water in some way and severe stomach pains are the most harmless ailments that occur after drinking it. So the conclusion can be drawn that the whole plant is uneatable due to its poison.\nThe velvet petal is another giant plant of the jungle. Its smell is surprisingly unremarkable but the plant's colourful petals catch easily the attention of the wanderer. They are somewhat hairy and soft and indeed feel like velvet to the touch. The plant is very fragile though so caution is advised. How such a plant manages to survive in the harsh jungle remains a mystery.\nThe devils tongue flower is another remarkable species of Tiquanda. A man feels quite dwarfish next to this impressive flower. The fact that its leaves, after being dried and grinded, give a spicy substance has led to numerous attempts of Venoran traders to cultivate this plant. It must be feared that they start harvesting that plant in the jungle and destroy the complete species if their efforts in growing this plant stays unsuccessful."

They undermine our society and the belief in the gods by their actions and their words. Some of them are crazy enough to think that they are true believers themselves. Their words erode the fundamentals of faith. They must be eliminated from our society. \nAs practitioners of dark and forbidden arts, witches are dangerous enemies as well. They must be avoided by all virtuous people that swore faithfulness to the gods. Witches are godless beings that even sacrifice evil creatures to get hold of their dark magic.\nThen there are the dammed, the undead. There are two types of them - ghosts and the walking dead. Both are insults to the teachings of the gods, and both were denied eternal peace, surely for a good reason. They try to kill all living beings. They must be destroyed on sight.\nThe worst enemies are demons. They are malicious creatures of immense power that plot the downfall of mankind. With all our power and might we have to oppose these servants of the dark one.\nAll of these enemies pose a threat on their own. We have to be aware of all their evil intrigues to be able to protect our souls. Only a devout and brave heart can triumph over their dark temptations. Those who fail and stumble, even only once, are at risk to become heretics themselves. Therefore we must not only watch ourselves but also our brethren and sisters to see if they might have fallen and turned into enemies. \nThe best weapons to fight evil are bravery and faith. They are not only the best available arms but also the prerequisite to fight evil at all. Brave followers of the true faith might of course arm themselves with additional weapons. A vial of holy water often works wonders when it comes to clean desecrated places and to drive out unholy entities. Often, a believer needs nothing than a holy symbol combined with his unwavering faith to ward off some of the less powerful evil beings.\nThe holy ground of temples dedicated to the good gods is a safe haven for everyone as it cannot be entered by the servants of evil. Certain holy relics in the possession of these temples are able to harm or even to defeat the mightiest servants of darkness.\nWe are all sinners and we should neither be proud of our faith nor be smug about it as pride and vanity are the first steps to heresy. We should be aware of our failures and plead for forgiveness every day."

It is obvious that the majority of the apes are trying to distract our guards while others sneak in and steal equipment of all sorts. Some of them are agile like ... well, like monkeys. Hard to catch - and they are sort of escape artists and might hide right under the ceiling. I even had one report of a citizen finding a monkey hiding in his depot box after a raid.

No sort of barricade would be of any help considering the nature of our attackers.\nThey get into and out of our fort just as it pleases them, and even the upper levels of the town that have proven to be safe against other beasts of the jungle are no hindrance to them.

This makes her hair silky and her skin fresh and vivid.\nThe application of a mixture of jungle rose petals, a flower from a fresh grave and peacock bone powder produces the same effect.\nDrinking mare's milk is also a good way to keep an appealing human form for an asura. Thereafter she should take black sesame seeds and soak them with the eggs of sparrows, boil them in milk and mix them with sugar. If she drinks this mixture and eats three fruits of the dragon nest tree she will keep her human form for five days.\nBut if she takes a bath in a young man's blood she may keep a lovely human form for the time of a full month."

The asuri are led by powerful princesses that are virtually invincible if confronted unprepared. However, even they have weaknesses. For example, the midnight asuri abhor heavy scents and the dawnfire asuri detest the sound of silver bells. In turn, the frost flower asuri can't stand anyone wearing red fabrics (not metal) near them. I have strong reason to believe that these weaknesses - as I call them - sufficiently weaken the otherwise powerful asura princesses, so they can be wounded.

First I was astonished: As this iceberg surely originates from Svargrond, so why wasn't it washed up north of Carlin or at least Thais? A study concerning the Tibian oceans' current conditions brought it to light: A strongly westward directed current of the Nordic Ocean prevents even a rather big ice bulk to be washed up north of Carlin. Instead it channels the iceberg through the passage between the islands Folda and Senja, past the Ghostlands west of Carlin. The current conditions of King's Gulf then direct the ice bulk through the strait between Fibula and Thais rather than channeling it into the bay. From there the drift would have directed the iceberg past Meriana as far as to the coast north of Darashia. But quite recently a heavy thunderstorm has torn it out of the current and washed the iceberg up here at the shoreline north of Port Hope. As it has already covered a long way, a part of the iceberg meanwhile surely has molten away. So the original size of this iceberg must have been vast. A chakoya clan inhabits the iceberg, but until now they are peaceful, yet curious. This is an extraordinary discovery! We already had knowledge about the Tibian oceans' current conditions, yet thus far it was unknown that bulks as big as this iceberg can travel so far by these currents. Thanks to this discovery I will be a renowned explorer soon! Yet, I'll have to stop my research for a short while and take a break in warmer surroundings, if I don't want to freeze completely \u2026"

Usually, only the eldest heir, his spouse and their firstborn heir are counted to this class. They own the factories or will own them one day, and the whole family fortune is at their disposal. They undergo a rigid training for their destiny and are schooled in reading, writing, magic and other important matters, depending on the tastes of the heads of the family.They are rarely seen in their factories and don't mingle with less than the upper class; and even this might be rare in some cases. The high class considers itself an elite, important for the city and irreplaceable. Since many town officials are relatives and somewhat dependent on their good will, their influence is sometimes bigger than the importance of their factories might suggest. They are subject to only a few rules and laws of the city, and are the only ones 'important' enough to vote on them.\nWhile in theory it is possible that one of the poor does so much for the city that, through his earned votes, he might become important enough to vote on rules that affect even the high class, this is practically impossible. Everything a poor person can do will grant him only a handful of votes at best, whereas simply owning a factory for a few months will generate enough votes to elevate someone to a status of importance. \nThe high class is quite eager to use their votes in a most efficient way, so they rarely vote on things that won't affect them at all. This gives the lower classes some autonomy in issues that affect only them. Since changing labour conditions and the like is considered a more important decision, only a few of the lower classes are allowed to vote on them at all and are easily overruled by the sheer number of votes a single factory owner owns. Therefore, they rarely waste their votes on such issues at all and leave it to the higher classes.\nThe upper class has the least votes in comparison, but the most privileges. Since the secondary heirs rarely rise to enough importance to vote about their own class, they sometimes sell their votes to interested higher class members who want to influence lower class decisions without wasting their own more valuable votes. Others generate some considerable amount of votes by working as city officials. Their importance allows them to influence matters that affect the city as a whole, and they are often flattered and ultimately bought by the higher class, mostly of their own family, to vote in their interest. Those officials lead a relatively comfortable life, and some may gather enough wealth to invest in a factory, or to support an artist or inventor. Sometimes this investment pays off, and sometimes this is how the second branch of the family surpasses the first."

        "text": "The Big Book of Glooth Pt.1\nIt's hard to imagine how life was before the breakthrough discovery of the glooth. Some hundred years ago, the first timid attempts were made to harvest and use the slime of the gloothworms. It was known it could be used to distil a strong glooth wine and in dire times, the substance was thickened and used as food by the poor. But only when inventor Baribar Glooth began his experiments and met with success, the usefulness of the worms and their product became apparent. The unassuming worms and their slime were named after that great man and soon others followed and discovered even more ways to manipulate, change and use glooth to the prosperity of all.\nBaribar had studied glooth for years and tried to manipulate it by heat, magic and the like with moderate success. Following a hunch, he used lightning magic on the slime and therefore changed the fate of Rathleton. The first experiments yielded only a solid but brittle substance. By changing the duration and intensity of exposition to energy, he managed to give the substance he created entirely different attributes. First and foremost his efforts concentrated on creating a substitute for metal. On his way to create what later would be known as gloothal, he discovered the elastic gloothy that today is produced in several standard elasticities that found a wide range of usage in the crafts and in daily life.\nHis assistant Dagomir pushed the research into discovering the properties of more liquid forms of glooth. By mixing the application of heat and lightning, he produced several by-products that were at first discarded, but used by later generations of inventors to expand into new areas of glooth usage. His final discovery, many years after the death of his former master and mentor Glooth, was the gloothomir, a substance that burned with a strange greenish flame that produces almost no heat compared to normal fire but burns for an extremely long time. Later generations refined the gloothomir to the gloothine that has similar properties but produced a lot of invisible smoke, while using itself up quicker than the gloothomir."

With the spread of glooth usage the demand for the slime grew to an extent where the worm farms could not keep up. Progress was stunted for several decades before a group of scientists made a breakthrough in breaking down garbage of glooth products into the basic slime they were originally made of. Others dedicated their research to finding some use for the by-products of glooth creation. Glooth spice and glooth pudding found their way into the homes of even the poorest to supply them with new glooth-born strength.\nWith increased reusability and more efficient worm farms and better worm breeding, the supply of glooth was once again secured, but it showed that overdependence was a danger. Efforts to gain other resources were renewed and increased. Still, the glooth inventions flourished even when experiments with other catalysts than energy and to some degree heat, met with little substantial results and ended up as an often mocked side note of science.\nIn our days it is hard to imagine what a world without glooth would look like. Our day begins when we clean our teeth with a gloothbrush and ends when we lay down in our beds with a glooth casting. This is something the glooth critics readily ignore in their unfounded rants against glooth, whenever they come up with their horror scenarios in which the glooth suddenly reverts back to its slime state, drowning each and everyone in Rathleton in a wave of slime. Those ungrateful enemies of progress just argue for argument's sake and shouldn't be given the attention they are desperately looking for. The glooth has led us to an age of prosperity and progress, and there is no way for a sane person to go back into the dark ages before the glooth."

Unsure it we were to continue with our initial plan nonetheless I sent word to the other dreammasters for a decision. Meanwhile I sent scouts to watch the strange inhabitants of this new land and get as much information about them as possible. After verifying that they were at least not openly in league with demons or the brotherhood, I decided to make contact. The people we met were seemingly completely human, albeit somewhat pale and of an tired and disinterested attitude. Although they obviously had never encountered a dwarf, they paid my right hand man only little more attention then anyone else. And that was little enough. This already made me suspicious and as we were invited by their leader to dine with him as honoured guests I told my men to be on guard. I postponed the invitation under the ruse of affairs I had to attend before, so I could use the time to see if my dream would grant me some insight and wisdom. As it is known those dreams are never direct, neither prophetic but with all this screams, carnage and bloodshed in my dreams there was little to be mistaken. Yet I refrained, as dreams are treacherous if threatened with ignorance. How easy it is to cause all that you dreamed about by your own actions because of your dreams. So we prepared potent antidotes and runes to deflect any attacks or traps that might await us. King Julas as he was called was a gentle enough host and the feast if not splendid was appropriate. Yet at the serving of the wine the magic amulet I had donned warned me about poison. I silently informed my men as I had told them in advance. Each of us secretly used an antidote rune on himself while others of us distracted our host and his retinue. As the evening turned to night our host was becoming more and more nervous, obviously waiting for his poison to take effect. Smiling inwardly I turned the polite discussion to the ways of our order, casually mentioned that we were known to reward our friends well and deal with traitors and their ilk swiftly and without mercy. More and more that Julas became nervous and more and more my talk became more stern and threatening. Only thinly veiled I finally had told him that I was aware about his treachery and were prepared to retaliate. Finally he broke in and with a shrieking voice he ordered his guards to attack. I and my men were accustomed to fight enemies more fierce then those men who where numerous but trained as militia or city-guardsman at best. We made sort work and soon most of them surrendered. King Julas though had retreated already. I interrogated the men at arms and learned that Julas as his father before him ruled the island with an iron and oppressive fist after years of freedom and prosperity. We searched the castle for Julas, fighting through some of his remaining men who offered only half-hearted resistance before giving up."

Let us just say he had done 'things' to his servants and his own body. The walls were smeared with blood in patterns that reminded me on magic symbols. He was barely alive, more then could be said about his poor servants, a dozens or so. And there was madness in his eyes. A madness that was so deep and intense that you could not stand the look of his eyes for long. He was babbling incoherent sentences and giggling and laughing all the while spittle dropped uncontrollable from his mouth. With his mutilations he might not have survived the night anyway but I was taking no chances. I had a pyre constructed and got rid of him before the turn of midnight. None of his subjects objected. That alone was proof I was right to do that.\nI assumed now things would take a turn for the better now. I assumed reign over the city awaiting the people to show some rightful successor I could accept and planed to go on with the construction of a base for our order. But perhaps I should have read my dreams better then that.\nAt first it became obvious that each and every night I tried to enter the dream realm I became trapped in nightmares of blood and soon sensed a presence of something malignant, evil but completely elusive that was stalking me. And more! There was something, not yet a voice though, that seemed to urge me to do even more vile and abominable thing as Julas had done.\nTo make matters worse each and every pretender for the throne the citizens half-heartedly presented seemed to be the descendant of the same degenerate branch of a family that hat two generations ago slaughtered any other of the royal lines to the last man. I sensed that non of them was to be trusted, each of one more depraved  then the other.\nSo I was in a dilemma. Through the malignant presence the isle was unsuitable for us as a base. No chance to create a dreampath here or to have dreams not tainted by whatever lurked here. On the other hand those people were in desperate need of leadership and something had to be done about whatever haunted this isle.\nSo with no resistance from the citizens who seemed rather glad that not another ruler of that degenerate line would be instituted I assumed the title of lord protector of the realm. Though I had to sent most of my men away to fight in other battles and the other dreammasters showed concern about my decision I think it was the right thing to do. I will lead this people to new prosperity and will see that the evil of the isle is contained while I work to find a way to destroy it once and for all."

        "text": "Since my arrival on the isle I have learned a lot of interesting things. Most of it is folklore of course, as the people sadly had little use for record as it seemed. What I found out, from ancient tales and crumbling tomes as well as from my explorations of the isle, granted me some insights. First of all, before men settled here some ancient race left its mark on the isle. From what I have seen, the remaining ruins indicate some advanced civilisation that pre-dated men. They commanded some technological knowledge beyond what I've seen anywhere. Perhaps those ancient ruins are all what's left from the mythical civilisation of Yalahar. Perhaps while strolling through Rathleton I've walked through what the ravages of time left over from the famous city itself? However, when the first humans arrived, the city had been abandoned and lain in ruins since long ago. The humans, wherever they might have come from, settled for a simple life in the ruins, in ignorance of the marvels ans wonders around them. Curiosity led them to some minor rediscoveries of ancient knowledge, but it seems they made little out of it. Some forages were made into the area of forging and the use of steam, whereas architecture was oddly neglected and people rather sook shelter in caves.\nIt is uncertain what exactly happened, but I assume at some point their digging and exploring awakened some ancient evil, something so powerful that they stood no chance of resistance. They were overwhelmed and enslaved by an entity that was drawn to sacrifices, and especially blood. But if any of the ancient fairy tales are worth something, it was not some vampire, perhaps not even a physical being. Nonetheless, dark times of servitude began for the people of the isle. Slavery and taxes in blood was their lot for many generations.\nThis did only change with the arrival of 'princess' Ramora. Now this person is shrouded in mystery, too. Though each story claims highest nobility for her, there is no record at all about such a princess in any archive that I had access to. This might mean nothing though, as it is entirely possible that this princess and her conquest date back to the last days of the mythical Corpse Wars. Though native lore and that of the invaders mingle here, it is often mentioned that things took place in the time when 'dead men walked'. Given the constant threat of the Corpse Wars, it seems likely that those incidents triggered the exodus of said princess and her people. Still, the nobility of this princess is disputable. Granted, there is next to no record that survived from those times. It is entirely possible that the princess was some tribe's ruler or something like that. The key here is that no heritage or title but that of 'princess' in her name connect to her in any existing lore. Knowing to what an end the nobility goes to preserve their family names, at least ist must strike one as odd that no traceable surname survived in all those tales. The next thing are clashing reports about how the exodus took place."

        "text": "While some stories claim that the princess ruled over a realm besieged by an endless stream of enemies (the undead perhaps), and that she ordered her remaining people to board their ships and set sail, others tell of a long journey through besieged lands, of endless battles that took their toll on her people until they reached the coast where they 'boarded the ships' and set sail. Now, the latter version suggests a perhaps darker version of the story, since the boarding of foreign ships would not have taken place without some force and warfare on its own. Yet in even other stories it is said that the 'goodly seapeople' took pity of the plight of the princess, and that their ships came from the mists to carry her people away. Interestingly, the 'seapeople' are a consistent element in various tales about the exodus. In one version, closest to the basic one, the king of the seapeople became smitten with the brave and strong princess and agreed to save her people if she bore him a child. Upon arrival at their destination, the pregnant princess denied the sea king his child and he therefore cursed her people to never be able to traverse the seas again. In several other stories, the seapeople at least encountered the princess and for some reason or other agreed to guide her through the sea that was in turmoil due to violent storms and savage sea creatures. Most descriptions of the seapeople picture them to be tall, slender, with pointy ears and bluish skin. I believe here the natives mixed up the seapeople with the elves from the stories of the newly arrived settlers.\nBe that as it may, the princess and her men finally ended up on an unknown coastline. Stories tell of an attempted ambush on her and her forces. It's entirely possible though that they already arrived as would-be conquerors. Regardless of this, it seemed certain that the populace of the isle was oppressed by some creature so that the princes did not have to fight the human population in any significant way. Instead, they fought the 'other minions' of the blood lord, often described as beasts entirely made up of blood and gore. It is likely that having fought in the Corpse Wars and having survived them, Ramora and her followers had weapons, tactics ans magic available to fight even such abomination, without running away screaming at the first confrontation. Finally they cornered and slew the beast that oppressed the isle. Probably in a gesture of unification she married (? the stories here a irritatingly vague) a local man that was declared to be some hero in the whole affair. Bringing with them more determination than the natives had and possessing some knowledge that was alien to them, the new arrivals changed the isle's civilisation significantly. Houses were built, the crude machines where put to a more efficient use, and more effort was put into understanding the relics of the past."

Perhaps there are only so many secrets to be unlocked in the mundane world, but only the secrets of magic are endless. But I'm getting carried away.\nIt seems that even with the destruction of the blood lord, some of his rituals prevailed. Perhaps there has always been a circle of trusted collaborators, who knows. When my order arrived here, that cult prospered again and had intoxicated the royal line. So when our detachment arrived here, the isle was again in the grip of a ruthless dictatorship and alliance with some gruesome blood cult.\nThe destruction of the cult led to a power vacuum that had to be filled. Two generations of lord protectors have until now overseen the well-being of the native people, and although it is increasingly hard to keep contact with the mainland, our protectorate flourishes. I consider myself fortunate that my superiors in the order allowed me to do my research here. I will prove to them that even without the abilities of dreamwalking I'm a useful member of the order. I've already planned several expeditions with the help of the natives, using old folklore as guidance. With the gracious help of the current Lord Protector, everything seems possible. Who knows what secrets I might discover. Perhaps I can prove that here is indeed what is left of the once proud city of Yalahar."

After their wedding the two scientists decided to go on a rather unusual honeymoon trip and to explore some recently discovered caves together. Venturing into the unknown depths beneath Rathleton they became cut off from their return route by a cave in. Using their unique knowledge of the subterranean flora and fauna they managed to survive and build a shelter to await some sort of rescue. Because they were assumed dead this rescue never arrived though. As time passed they became aware that they would have to work on their rescue all alone. This became more complicated by the pregnancy of the wife. They decided to focus on survival first and to find a way to escape later on. The husband begun the capture and training of caveworms, a more social and less dangerous cousin of the rotworm. They were used as means of digging, hunting for food and providing some protection against the more aggressive rotworm colonies nearby. For a while some sort of stability was achieved and the woman gave birth to a boy. Due to unforeseen complications in birth the wife never fully recovered from pregnancy. So it was up to the husband and his caveworms to provide them nourishment and shelter. The attacks of the rotworms continued and became even more fierce. The couple did it's best to raise their child and give it the best education they could provide under this circumstances. At some point the wife's strength finally failed her and she died in her sleep. The grief stricken husband was ridden with guilt and his spirit broken. So one day he let his guard down and their shelter was overrun by rampaging rotworms. He sacrificed his life to allow his son to escape, accompanied by their most trusted caveworms. That much could be deduced by later excavations and reading some remaining notes of the couple and also due to remarks of captain caveworm to some of the people he met and befriended. What then had happened to the boy is a wild mix of myth, speculation and deduction.\nIt seems the caveworms kind of raised him as one of their own and he learned to live in the caveworm way. It is said that the caveworms discovered a small colony of worms that were closely related to the goothworm and yet astonishing different on several regards. The kid used them as one of his food sources what begun to change him even more than the environment and his foster parents already did. He developed uncanny senses and his teeth and fingernails became incredibly hard and sharp. He also acquired a high grade of agility and a flexibility of his body to wind his way even through the narrowest and winding tunnels.\nFor some years he lived the adventurous life of a caveworm until one day the rotworms found his new home. This time though the youth would not flee but use his new found powers to fight back. He managed to slay the murderous worms but his new shelter was destroyed and his foster parents were killed."

        "text": "The perilous adventures of captain caveworm Pt. II\nHe lonely roamed the caves for a while but eventually the youth begun to long for human companionship and used his skills to search for the people of his parents. It seemed the first people he encountered were some simple glooth farmers in some remote caves. They befriended the shy kid and took him in. He once more showed his ability to adapt and soon grasped the concepts of human society. But not all he learned though appealed to the youth who had grown up with the lectures of his scientific parents and the simple but just way of the caveworms. The kid got himself into some fights against what he saw as unjust and oppressive and he had to flee once again. This time he returned under the cover of a made up identity and kept a low profile. Since his sense of justice had not been diminished he created yet another identity, that of a masked freedom fighter whose uniform bore the likeness and symbolism of the caveworms. For a while 'the worm' appeared out of nowhere, where the weak were severely mistreated, to bring them freedom and punishment to their oppressors.\nThis culminated into a battle against a powerful factory owner who not only abused his workers but also secretly planned to take over the city. After years of battles in the shadows this lead to a desperate attempt of the factory owner to hastily use his private army to overthrow the government before his schemes were revealed to the public. He might have succeeded if not for the masked figure who managed to lead a huge army of caveworms and other subterranean beasts against him.\nThe factory owner was defeated and his mysterious opponent disappeared into the darkness of the caves once again. In the gloothpapers he first had many new names like 'the worm general' but soon the public begun to call him captain caveworm instead.\nIn the days to come the mysterious man would switch more and more to fighting powerful criminals who he saw as a more immediate threat for the people. And indeed there seemed to be no shortage of freaks, mad scientists and criminal masterminds to keep him occupied. Some of the most notorious arch enemies that Captain Caveworm acquired over the years were the nefarious Dr. Dentist, the seductive Minowoman, the sinister Mean Green, the lethal Glooth Fairy and the powerful Pulverizer.\nThe captain never made a public appearance and his existence is shrouded with myth and rumours."

It is covered with giant scrawls that are often blotched and nearly unreadable, as if written by hands unused to holding a pen)\nDay 4 - I have contacted the Stantons through my loyal messenger Maro. Maybe a spell, a rune, a potion can heal me? I hope Emily is fine and does not worry too much, I have been gone for several days now... Perhaps I should write to her? But what do I tell her? That this... hide is covering my skin as to make me unable to touch her? Oh no no, I cannot do this. I cannot let her see me, imagine me like this! Better to leave her in doubt than this horrible knowledge. Alaistar has promised to look after her. That must be enough for now. Oh, how I long to shed these vile scales that cover my skin!\n...\nDay 35 - The Stantons know of no potion or spell that can cure me. I am doomed to stay here until I find an antidote. Luckily, I have, at least for now, all I need to conduct the necessary experiments; it was a lucky hunch that led me to build the particle accelerator here instead of in the factory! Who knows, maybe this transformation put me on the lead to a new invention? But if yes, which one, to what end? I cannot think why anyone should wish to look and feel as grossly confined in this massive, ogrish body as I do. Oh, to be human again!\n...\nDay 46 - At least I do not need sleep in this brutish form, but how I wish there was some human company! And what about Emily? ... I must not dwell on these thoughts. I must find a cure. I must!\n...\nDay 61 -  The salve only thickened this horrible hide that covers and deforms my body. But I cannot give up. I must think of Emily. I have written some letters to make sure our family fortune will not be withheld from her, but will my family, will Carefew have accepted those letters as my own? I must ask my messenger about the news from above.\n...\nDay 65 - This is disastrous! Maro says that my letters were not accepted, that Carefew said they were frauds! FRAUDS! How dare he! He cannot deny it is my sigil, but he says my writing has been forged. FORGED! By the gods above and below! Has he lost all decency, to leave Emily bereft of what is rightly hers? Oh, the infamy! But I see how it is. Carefew has never been a friend of mine, and seeks revenge through vile attacks on my dearest. If only I could ascertain that my writing IS still unchanged! Oh, if only someone had old writings from me that I could study! But with these enormous hands, what is there to be done? Would devising a writing golem help? But oh no no, the golem could still not copy my style. This is wretched, wretched indeed!\n...\nDay 243 - I am near desperation. Maro has informed me he can no longer be my messenger to the world above. Will this torment never end?\n...\nDay 352 - Another failure. I can't get the recipe to work. Oh my dearest Emily, will I ever see you again?\n...\nDay 456 - I am on the lead of something. I think it may be the mixture of gases that caused the chain reaction in the factory. Maybe if I can reverse the effect?\n...\nDay 581 - After weeks of endless tests, I must conclude that gases were a dead end. Nothing worked. Maybe not a potion, but a slowly dissolving pill or lozenge? If the ingredients were to release their effects step by step, internally, would they reduce this thick, hideous hide? Must research.\n...\nDay 876 - Maybe tonight I will finally have the breakthrough, I feel it is within my grasp! The latest experiments have been very promising. Oh Emily... wait for me, my darling.\n...\nDay 1001 - I must not, I cannot give up! There must be a way to undo this! Maybe I have been wrong to indulge in this diary. I shall leave the days uncounted from now on, and only think of my goal. All I need now is a messenger. Time will show me a way, I am certain of it. Oh Emily, my love. My thoughts are with you, always."

        "text": "A Venture through the Oramond Fields, by Doctor Alaistar Stanton.\nThe Oramond Fields that surround the city of Rathleton hold many a marvel to behold. The grasslands are home to many small and larger animals, peaceful like the gloothworms and aggressive like the devourers. Indeed, glooth is what has given the fauna and flora of the isle its particular shape.\nStudying old carcasses in the deeper earth layers have led me to believe the creatures may have looked differently in earlier centuries. Glooth residue varies in the bones, indicating the creatures absorbed it somehow and were changed by it - the bones are similar, but not quite alike those of today's animal inhabitants.\nThe flora of Oramond is less developed than the fauna. Again, I believe the glooth to be the reason. Though in earlier days, maybe the climate was milder too before the mists closed in. The few trees that grow in the shelter of the city centre are the last remnants of forests that must have once covered the southern grasslands. But when the weather grew colder and darker through the mist clouding the skies and keeping off the warm winds, they must have retreated. The gloothworms, revelling in damp and cold earth, spread, and I believe their soaking the earth with glooth residue must have prevented the tree seeds from growing again. The grazing animals consequently chose to eat more of the glooth-imbibed grasses, and adapted to the changed environment, while the carnivores, feeding on them in turn, absorbed the glooth through their prey.\nThough much of this is still theory, I am confident that through ongoing research I will one day have a reliable amount of data on the natural history of Oramond to prove my assumptions right."

Each of them has an inscription, which gives a hint on what the statue wishes. I assume if one can fulfil all four wishes, something will happen, yet I don't know what this 'something' could be.

But seemingly you are able to keep away from them the important information about your actual goals and intentions. Furthermore your succes in establishing a makeshift laboratory in the tunnels under Rathleton and even acquiring some novel glooth based weaponry speaks for itself. The mutated glooth you mentioned in your last letter is an interesting matter. Perhaps it is useable in an arcane way to enhance spells or improve potions. Even the creation of yet unknown artefacts could be possible. We think your endeavours are taking a good path.\nWith best regards\nUquora the High-Handed of the Circle of the Black Sphinx"

Our valued assistant Tassondis, whom I always held in the highest regard, had a remarkable idea - replicas! We established Site XVII and rebuilt the two exhibits the other researchers found - near perfect copies - so both our teams could study them separately! Of course we had the advantage of being able to work in a practically ideal environment as well as in secret. We used this to our advantage and, due to the help of Tassondis, managed to decipher the second relic in no time! The results have been added both to the current research documents, as well as our own records (note: Compendium Site XIV and XVII, edited) and will be removed from this document for obvious reasons.\n<the next pages of this document have been removed, the last page has some notes scribbled on the back>\nGetting to the bottom of walls VB and VC was pretty obvious, Tassondis wasn't even the first one to understand them. Both engraved walls are part of the larger Ab'Dendriel exhibit, very similar to the smaller one, which is located on the surface. The other two sides on the back of the exhibit, VA and VD, are not even part of the solution. And when I told him that both walls are probably interconnected with a single unique meaning, he reacted quite surprised and immediately got to work. He made quick progress and suddenly HE was the one who saved the day. He didn't even mention me! And I doubt he would have even perceived the engravings on the stones at all! He called all exhibits they found \"magic stones\"! Magic stones? What is this! He clearly has no idea what he is talking about, nor how significant our work here actually is. Careful observation of the Ab'Dendriel exhibits would have shown him that there is more to the surface of these strange menhirs than meets the eye. Who could have known that a considered researcher like him would literally only get a hint if it jumped right at him?\nIf you ever take the time to read this, Cannos, don't just let Tassondis get away with this. This discovery was a team effort, you of all people should know this.\nKhuun"

Yet I fear I have sacrificed too much of my humanity to truly connect to its call and read its meaning. But that is only a temporary hindrance. In the end, it will be my power that controls the grail and bends it to my will! I wonder if I should put more effort into reviving that blood lord. I still think it's possible, but given what little information we have we can't be sure what it truly is, and if we can bind it to our cause. Then again, a puppet blood lord might be just what I need to find the grail. It certainly shares strong connections with this artefact. Yet I wonder who was the master, and who the tool. The others seem to think I'm only on a mission to recruit another legionnaire, and are oblivious to the existence of the grail - for now. As soon as the word spreads, they will come for its power. I cannot allow any of them to best me in this bid for power. The grail might increase my status in the legion tenfold. I might be called to serve under the master himself. Yet, what if the power of the grail is great enough to rival that of the master? Will he allow me to keep it? Hardly. Thinking of it, he might even bestow it on one of his champions. That I cannot allow to happen. I must acquire the grail, bend its power under my will and confront my peers and superiors from a position of power! The grail has ever been a source of corruption. And all that while remaining hidden and unused. What power will it have if used directly? Kingdoms may crumble under my will. I can subvert them from within. And the power over blood - I'm sure the grail was used by the blood lord to create his minions. If I had such a tool I reckon it could elevate me over some of the most powerful monster makers of the legion.But I have to be careful. The legion is not to be underestimated. They are not such fools as the Brotherhood of Bones was. To think I once associated with them is deeply embarrassing in hindsight. It is a good thing I cut off all connections before their demise. However, the legion is a completely different beast; and the master, well, as shrouded in mystery as he is, to hold such a diverse group of powerful individuals together and bind them to a cause shows how much power he commands. Though perhaps it might be possible to challenge him with the power of the grail - but on the other hand, it may be wise to take the grail into hiding and study it thoroughly before making my move. I'd better make my decision once I have the grail in my hands and can assess its power somehow. For now, I have to focus on my current task and play along with the legion."

However, they form a beautiful and complex whole. The isle of Oramond shows signs of long-dead creatures that have arrived at different times here and, sometimes, strove for supremacy, leaving only inexplicable ruins, as well as signs of younger creatures that arrived maybe only some generations ago. However, the different species do not mingle and are often very reluctant to make peaceful contact.\nI.i. Of Minotaurs and Men\nAmidst the newer species, one must count the minotaurs and the humans. While the minotaurs are the newer arrivals, both have been settled here long enough to vie for supremacy of the island, trying to eradicate the other. Yet while our own origins are still shrouded in mist, there are ancient ruins on this isle that seem man-made. The minotaurs seem to have evolved on another island or continent though. They are not natives to this isle who left and returned when the mist lifted, but are new arrivals on this isle, which they immediately claimed as their own. Closer examination of their camps and habits led me to the hypothesis that they may have followed a call of some bold chieftain or supreme ruler of theirs, searching for a holy, paradisical land, which led them to the isle and which they must defend from the grip of barbarians, the humans."

It is located north of Oramond, bordered by high mountains to the south, a wild sea to the east, huge cacti forests to the west and rocky hills to the north. At the rugged shores of Krailos one may find many shipwrecks, as the area is surrounded by treacherous underwater shelves.\nKrailos itself is mainly covered in sandy plains and has a rather hot climate, which has led to a sparsely spread population. This means most of the ogres live in small tent villages. There is just one bigger settlement, which is home to the Bloody Skulls tribe. Also, some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. The country's landscape is harsh: rocky beaches, dried-up salt lakes, rugged rock formations and dry, barren fields number among the reasons why the area is avoided by foreigners. Another reason of course are the ogres themselves."

        "text": "Upon Ogre Society - An ethnological essay, by Larek the Wayfarer\nBuilt upon the violent battles and wrongdoings of its past, Krailos is now among the most unconnected countries in its corner of the world, characterised by bitter struggles and a harsh environment. The ogres'  hunting skills and physical strength are among their current greatest benefits; and the mountains of Krailos hold some rare minerals. On the other hand, Krailos lacks a lot in infrastructure and clean water.\nKrailos is a tribal nation, divided into several different clans. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre (although in some cases a particularly violent or domineering ogress claims the title). The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. Within a tribe, there may be a couple of opposing individuals against the current chieftain, but overt struggles for leadership are rather uncommon. Each tribe is independent of the others, and conflicts between two tribes occur frequently. However, the greatest threat to the ogres actually is the desiccation of the lakes and rivers. But the current chieftains are too preoccupied with their tribal conflicts to seek solutions for this issue.\nThe ogres are simple, warlike people, more interested in a fight and good food than in politics. Elimination of competitors is an accepted way of moving up in the ogre ranks. Ogres like conflict. They are impulsive, quick to anger and do not hold back their opinions regardless of who might take offense. Ogres prefer to solve conflicts through combat rather than words. Yet, an honorable death is not the highest purpose in an ogre\u2019s life, but rather a fulfilled life, which primarily means enough food and a comfortable hut. Ogres are distrustful towards strangers and tend to welcome them with avoidance in the best case. Lately yet, a tribe called the Bloody Skulls has shown a sort of interest in trade with other peoples.\nA kind of spiritual shamanic animism holds a certain importance in the ogres' lives and each tribe\u2019s shamans are always renowned members of the society. The common ogres are moderately spiritual and have rites of passage and annual rites concerning the seasons and certain weather phenomena. Ogres worhip The Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (food but also living creatures) to feed this entity. Otherwise, ogres care only for the here-and-now.\nContrary to common prejudices, ogres are at least a little more than mindless brutes. They possess a talent for animism and have certain artisanal skills. For example they have developed passable methods of curing and tanning hides, so their leatherwork is quite convenient. Despite their great passion for eating the ogres don\u2019t have a reputation as outstanding cooks as their meals seldom match other peoples\u2019 taste. Ogres eat especially meat \u2013 of hunted animals but also the meat of humanoids, mainly humans and elves. This is the reason they also are referred to as \u201cmaneaters\u201d. It is important to mention that they never give in to cannibalism. Besides meat they also love sweet tasting things, such as honey combs or cakes, although they don\u2019t get the latter too often."

We are glad to have solid ground under our feet even though it only seems to be sea ice. Everyone is exhausted so we will start to explore that area not before tomorrow.\nDay 5:\nWhat a mess! Every morning, since the day we stranded on this cursed piece of frozen water, one of my crew members disappears or lies dead in his berth terribly battered. Something evil is going on here and I swear to find out what that is... if I stay alive long enough.\nDay 7:\nLast night, we have been ambushed. About two dozens of small, furry creatures launched a well organised attack against us. The rest of my crew was without the slightest chance. I managed to hide myself here in my cabin without being recognised. I am such a coward, it would have been better if I had died with my crew.\nDay 10:\nIn the last three days, I continued to explore the area around here and made an exciting discovery. To the south, there is a small ice cavern in which one of those beasts is hiding. It behaves quite differently than its fellows. As far as I can judge, this one is not hostile. Maybe it is possible to get in contact with it and gather some information about its species.\nDay 13:\nI found out that they call themselves \u201cchakoya\u201d and the only thing they really like is fish. Nothing but fish. However, the one in the cave is very picky and doesn't like the 'usual' type of fish. The creature seems to be hunted by its species but I don't know why. I have to be careful. After I left the cave, I saw a few of its fellows which were patrolling the area. I hope they didn't see me."

If she have been sent to a good magical college, she might have become a magician of some renown. On the other hand, she is much more interested in worldly affairs and less in research. However, her influence on her people is growing and the spells I taught her earned her great respect. Only the old fashioned clique of druids still oppose her, despite of her obvious power and the knowledge she had gained from me. Some things are seemingly always the same, everywhere in the world.\nThe Carlin miners are a thick-headed and stubborn bunch. Can't they see that they are not welcome here? Why don't they just leave? However, there are more important things to do. I have unlocked some of the secrets of the frostspire shard. After all these centuries that have passed and the shattering of the frostspire, that released all the contained cold all over the isles, there is still power in this shard. I manipulated some of it's essence to slow my ageing process! What a triumph of science! That alone will make me the greatest magician of all times! But I am sure there is more about this shard! My apprentice sent some of her loyal followers to find more of the shards. The shattering of the frostspire must have produced thousands and thousands of them.\nAfter the first success, the research got really slow. I am able to tap the powers of the shards and drain them for my purposes but that is not very sufficient. One of the few direct effects, I can derive of the shards, is the slowed ageing process for me and my apprentice. Other things progress similarly slowly. There seems little left of the ancient civilisation that once retreated here. I begin to assume that they did not only use the frostspire to bind all that cold to create a hospitable environment, but they also used the contained cold to build their settlements. What a sight it must have been, a green and warm isle with cities of crystal gleaming ice! The shattering of the frostspire probably let this architecture erode over the centuries.

Considering that my investigations here will bind me to these ice islands for some time, it might be a good idea to take some of them into my servitude. Yet, the primitives behaved quite unfriendly and it is questionable how I should be able to repay them for any services. However, pressing them into servitude is no true option. I have not the time to oversee a bunch of rebellious slaves that know the lands far better than I do. There has to be some other way.\nIt was easy to lure this greedy shaman witch into an alliance. Some display of my abilities combined with blandishments and empty promises and she was mine. Time will tell if this primitive will make a useful apprentice. Her influence among her people is undoubtedly considerable though.\nMarvellous! It was so easy to find the remains of the frostspire with the help of my local helpers! Of course it has become a place of importance in their primitive myths. Everything I encountered is true about the ancient myths! Sadly all-too-true. Not much is left from the magnificent frostspire itself and all signs of the ancient civilisation seem to be wiped out. But there is so much to be discovered and we just started.\nToday my apprentice gave me a holy item of her people's faith. At first, I was annoyed to be disturbed with such primitive nonsense but to my amazement the object was obviously a shard of the shattered frostspire itself! A short investigation showed me that it will take months to unlock the secrets of its inherent magic. I will need a more suitable base and more resources. In the meantime, settlers from Carlin have arrived. Some prospectors must have find ore in the mountains. Damn them, they are disturbing my research."

It is cold, and I can barely hold the stylus. ... I believe I am not alone. I see strange things moving, behind the walls. Am I hallucinating? Maybe there is a way through to somewhere else, somewhere warm, if I could only break the ice. But my sword broke trying to reach the strange glitter and movement, and I am without hope."

So far our plans seemed to have worked well. We enticed the radicals trying to start a fur trading on their own. Although now it might be easy to drop a hint to the barbarians to detoriate their relationship with Carlin, it might be possible that the witches are more efective in their operations then we are. Therefore I decided to scout their cave and try to kill them so we can rather overtake the operation as a whole instead of busting it. Sadly the damned giants have better noses then eyes and I got caught. The witches forced me to drink something and I lost consciousnes. I'm quite sure I told them everything whle they had drugged me, because they never bothered to ask me anything after I woke up again. Now I'm trapped in a frozen cell. But those witches can't hope to hold someone of my legendary skill for long! I will find my way out and have my revenge."

        "text": "On perchts - Part I\nWhile superstitious men of past ages saw the percht as somewhat of a magically enhanced natural disaster, modern scholars managed to figure out more about their true nature. In popular belief the winter opens doorways to the home realms of the percht through which they enter our world to haunt its inhabitants. Through diligent research, however, solid proof emerged that the percht are denizens of our own plane. What we know as percht are not entities on their own but rather a shape of other spirits, that inhabit our own world. The origin of the percht are usually invisible minor spirits that inhabit our world since the dawn of time. Is is theorised that those spirits are randomly created as byproducts of creations of the gods. Therefore old texts describe such spirits metaphorically as sparks of the forges of creation. Such spirits are usually insubstantial and of minor power. Over time they adopt features and traits of their surroundings. Some may become attached to a spring or a clearing in the woods, while those in cities might become attached to houses or families. While some might manifest as pranksters, they usually are protective of their object of interest. Yet they might still develop their own view on things and might punish aberrations from their ideals with more or less malicious pranks. They are the source of tales of woodcutters, haunted with bad luck while trying to fell a particular tree or a sloppy baker that fails to clean up his bakery to receive a beating by unseen assailants in his bed. Most of those spirits are never noticed, though, and some are even helpful and benevolent. The problem arises when the cold of winter creeps into the land. Like water changes to ice, the cold turns those spirits into something entirely different. Their frozen form is by far more material and visible. Also their usually harmless attitude changes vehemently. The more the cold takes hold on them, the more they become one of the percht. In their frozen percht stage many of them become malignant and destructive. Also they become obsessed with cold and want to spread it over the whole world for all eternity. Percht are usually afraid of warmth and fire. It's also known that certain loud noises can cause them discomfort or even make them shatter. Some folk tale claim that they are afraid or ashamed by their own mirror image, although they seem not to care much about the presence and appearance of other percht. They are not really accustomed to their solid forms and usually try to fly and hover, which leads to an awkward jumping movement. Their senses are limited or they are just not used to them so they can sometimes be fooled by a disguise. They seem to have some holy places that they protect with powerful magic wards that dull the mind and cause nausea. One of those places is the lair of their powerful leader, others are just hideouts or ritual sites for their ghastly ceremonies to dull the sun."

        "text": "On perchts - Part II\nThey usually carry some shed of their former selves and might still be obsessed with certain places or things like tidiness. This can only be deduced by their behaviour, however, since the percht seem unwilling or unable to communicate and some are known to repeat some phrases again and again. This seems more like the behavior of parrots then actual patterns of speech. Some percht are strong enough to retain a good portion of their former self and realise their predicament of been trapped in a solid form. Most of those percht are quite old and lived through numerous such transformations. With the coming of summer the percht begin to melt and eventually the originating spirit is set free again. Violence against a percht's solidly frozen body is another way to free the trapped spirits and so even the still sane percht might entice someone to attack and destroy them. In their percht state those spirits that embraced their new state are destructive and mildly dangerous. Their ultimate goal is to postpone or even better prevent the coming of spring. To this end they swear fealty to the oldest of their kind. The oldest tales predating mankind call her by many names. The frozen crone, the hag that rides the winter storm, mother death-chill or the matriarch of winter. In our days folklore simply calls her the percht queen. As such she has found her way into myth and faerie tales, usually as the antagonist, although a select few tales attribute her with some redeeming qualities like the admiration and even rewarding of diligence and duty or admitting her defeat in the face of true love. Though some assume she is just some old spirit that got trapped in the percht state for all eternity she herself gave other accounts. To some of her unwilling guests she claimed to have always been an entity of winter and cold and it was her who wove her spells into the cold that entrapped spirits to become her percht servants. She claimed that is is her who dulls the light of the suns and that there were ages in the past in which she ruled uncontested and the fiercest winter imaginable held the land in it's grip the whole year on, without any spring to be seen. She claimed that the coming of the next age of her regency is inevitable and eventually the work of her and her percht minions will succeed. While of course such outrageous claims of an age of ice are absurd at best, the threat of the queen and her percht is a real one and only vigilance and diligence can ward her off for another year."

        "text": "The bear and the percht queen\nIn the land of Ollre lived an old and wise bear. The land was lush and it's streams full of fish on which the old and wise bear fed well.\nBut one year the power of the percht queen was growing and the autumn turned chilling cold. Snow started falling and the streams froze over.\nThe hungry bear was unable to catch any fish at all, growing more and more desperate.\nWhen he was trying to break the thick ice in vain, he was mocked by the evil percht queen.\nShe taunted him about how her cold would cause him to starve.\nThe bear looked at her without any anger and was lost in deep thought.\nWhen the mocking triad of the crone had ended, he finally spoke to her.\n'Hear me glorious mother winter, praised be your reign. I would gladly be your servant until the seasons change but sadly I'm too weak and hungry right now.'\nThe flattered crone considered his words and the bear continued.\n'If your majesty would stay her hand until the moon tuns, I will happily enter your service until the end of winter.'\nThe ice hag pondered the idea and ultimately agreed that having the mighty bear as her humble servant would not only be useful but also emphasise her own status.\nWinter withdrew until the moon turned and the bear eagerly went fishing, catching and eating as much fish as never before.\nWhen the moon turned the bear had not shown up in the palace, the percht queen got furious.\nWith an entourage of percht she traveled to the lair of the bear to demand her due.\nBut the bear was soundly asleep and nothing the queen and her minions did could wake him up.\nThe bear had eaten so much that his hibernation was unbreakable.\nThe percht queen angrily retreated in defeat.\nWhen the bear awoke in the spring though he learned that the tries of the percht had coloured his fur as white as snow.\nThus, he became the father of all ice bears."

Mostly harmless, they tend to destroy food supplies and can become dangerous in greater numbers to the bad equiped human.\nThe snake - The poisonous snakes hide in the woods and near the northern swamps. They usually can be found at the shores more often then in the isles centre. They are not too dangerous to a adventurer with some basic equipment. If poisoned it is a wise decision to run straight to the monk who guards the soul vortex, where everyone enters the world of Tibia, and ask for healing.\nThe spider - Similarly dangerous as the rat, the spiders were found by the first explorers of the isle and are native to Rookgard. They live above and beneath ground and tend to live and hunt in packs to increase their danger.\nThe wolf - There are some smaler wolf packs on this isle. Wolves are fast, tough and dangerous. Often they are the hunters and not the hunted on this island. It is a good decision to engage them in combat only with decent equipment and try to fight them only one on one.\nThe troll - Though intelligent in a limited way, the cowardish trolls are not a threat to our small outpost. They are able to create and use some basic equipment and quite tough to lesser weapons and unskilled fighters. Follow the advise to have mastered some basics in shielding, before you challenge even one of them.\nThe bear - Bears are hard to beat! Keep that in mind before challenging one. If you are unexperienced and have no good equipment, retreat is the tactic of choice. Best kill them in small hunting parties and use terrain to your advantage."

We are lucky not to have encountered any of the more dangerous orcs like warriors or berserkers on this isle.\nThe poison spider - Roughly only slightly tougher then the ordinary spider it can poison you. Try to avoid such fate since they usually live far from our base and you might not make it to our local monk for healing.\nThe bug - The bug is not that dangerous. More an annoyance then a threat to an adventurer of some experience. It might become a lethal threat to a perfect rookie. With some preparation they should not be worth to bother about.\nThe deer - Deers are a fine supply for food and are non-agressive animals and try to flee on sight. It might be difficult to catch them and you might easily enter the territory of a local predator while chasing them.\nThe rotworm - A creature of decay that lives underground like its small cousin, the earthworm. Its toothed maw is a formidable weapon and rotworms have torn more then one adventurer to pieces. A horde of them might kill anyone, so great caution is advised while encountering them.\nOther beasts - It is certain, that other beast live in the dungeons of our isle. But they are not numerous enough to become recognized yet. If you encounter any unknown beast it is certainly dangerous and a potential lethal enemy. Don't underestimate them.\nThe wasp - fast and deadly to the unexperienced. Their speed makes them dangerous, even more in high numbers."

On rookgaard there is an oak-like plant which fruits resemble bananas in shape and taste. No one can make out the difference of the fruits. To all people without knowledge in botanology: the only hint to find a bananatree is the white blossom flower that often seems to grow in a kind of symbiosis with the cherry tree.\nThe dragon tongue plant is easily spotted by its deep red blossoms and rumoured to be an useful reagent in various alchemical potions.\nThe swamp plants appear in such large number and variety that we didn't have a chance for extensive classification."

He stepped into existence and began immediately with the act of the creation, because he was fully creative power and impatient. His godly powers emerged from him and created, formed. But all his works slipped out of his hands as the void was everywhere. No single work was to last. Everything that he devised dissolved in the void even before it was completed. Uman Zathroth regarded his undertakings thoughtfully, because Uman Zathroth was wise and fullfilled with magic powers and insatiable hunger for knowledge, comprehension and enlightenment. He was a creature similar and nevertheless different to the clear working of the Fardos, because mysteries and secrets were the aspects of his being. Uman and Zathroth were two entities and nevertheless one. Uman was the light, bright aspect of the magic strength. His was the gift to work benign wonders. Zathroth however, his different - dark - side, was corruptive urge, the vain self purpose of magic, destructive and a desecration! This entity, which was two and one nevertheless, observed now the works of his companion in infinity."

Thus Fardos and Uman strived together to attempt the CREATION - however their laborings were not rewarded with success again. Just like before everything was drained away as soon as they created it, and Zathroth laughed full of contempt. The power however, which Uman and Fardos spent, did seep away in the universe-filling void. Nobody knows whether it was this power that lured another entity to them, whether it aroused this godly being, or whether in a mysterious way it created this entity. In any event, suddenly the enormous entity Tibiasula rose from the void and examined the two other godly beings. Fardos and Uman welcomed Tibiasula as their sister and admired her, because she was the perfect unity of the elements. Zathroth however fumed with silent hate, as he didn't want to share the void with one more entity."

And to remedy that he invented TIME!\nIn order to create the time, the Gods united their powers. Even Zathroth was fascinated by the idea of his other half and contributed a tiny proportion of his strength to the effort. The wise claim that it is to be due to his working that all time strives in the long run to decay and destruction.

Finally Uman found a solution: the birth, which created live from live. One of the Godly had to unite with one of the elements and could thus create a new entity. Thus Fardos and the Fire united, and the Fire bore two children, Fafnar and Suon, the Suns of Tibia. Suon of calm and considerate nature. But Fafnar, its sister, was self-willed and stubborn. She rose vainly over the elements and began to scorch them. Therefore Suon also rose up in order to stop his sister. A wild struggle started and pretty soon it turned out that Suon was the stronger one of the two. So Fafnar fled under Tibia into the parental fire, but Suon wanted his sister to promise him never to scorch the other elements again."

Uman gave humans the art of magic and instructed them in the magic crafts. But even the sorcerers could not turn the tables. Some of them turned thereupon away from Uman and called Crunor their lord, in order to serve from then on as druids for the forces of the life. Together with the godly world tree Crunor they created many of the creatures, that populate the wilderness today, although a variety of these creatures was extinguished in the wars of that time. Banor however chose the noblest of the mortal ones, Kirana, as its wife, and she bore him Elane, which possessed as much virtue as combat and magical powers. And she became the first of the noble paladins. Until our times the leader of the paladins is in honors to her a woman and assumes the honorary name Elane."

With these champions as leaders the humans turned the tables in the great war. \nThey alone under all the mortals had the possibility of becoming similar to Banor, uniting power and cunning.

Only gradually the recovering sections of the old world started to rise from the nebulas of time, awakened the old races and old frights back to life. It is said that the city of Tibia was the first to rise again, barren of almost all life, without all magic, on a tiny island, deserted and almost devoid of life ... and nevertheless full of age-old secrets. And soon\nafterwards life returned to the world. Also via the portal of souls old and new heroes found their way to Tibia. Gradually larger sections of the old world emerged from the nebulas, further natures and miracles. But the world is still far from its former splendour and size, and we live in times of change. What today is still natural, may as soon as tomorrow be only a legend, what today is still fantasy, may already tomorrow be reality. But hear ye and listen: Bad spirits also arrived and still arrive by the portal in our realm, in order to do mischief in human shape.

As the greedy gnome saw that she was carrying a bag full of finest bread and a flask of wine, he pretended to be starving and begged the little girl for food and water in a way anoying as only gnomes can be (and that's pretty anoying). But the girl was warned of treacherous gnomes by a valiant huntsman she met before and she quickly ran away from the greedy little gnome. The gnome became angry but was afraid to steal from her, because she might have been stronger than him. So he wandered into the woods cursing as only gnomes can curse (and that's pretty ugly). By chance he almost stumbled over a sleeping bard. Quickly figuring out the magical nature of the flute lying near the sleeping bard, he stole it as quickly as only a gnome can do (and that's pretty quick). Using the magic flute he lured a pack of wolves to the little girls grandmas house and let the beasts chase both into the wilderness and laughed wickedly as only gnomes can laugh (and that's pretty wicked). Laughing the gnome gulped the wine and swallowed the bread as fast as only gnomes can (and that's pretty fast). So he lived in the woods and molested squirrels happily ever after."

I would have done the same thing to others  a few hundred years ago. But now I'm tired and would almost welcome death to halt this never-ending cycle of intrigue and bids for power. I never imagined how hollow all those things would become that I carved for so long. But after losing and winning all over and over again, it all grows stale. All my accomplishments are only adding to the amount of reasons why I have to watch my back. After gaining all this power, you have to invest a considerable deal of it just to secure it. Though you then have the power to make decisions, the good ones only lead to envy and minions undermining them, and the bad ones might give a rival the chance to strike at you. However, this should not turn into a philosophical treatise of some sort; neither become an excuse for what I have done. I have committed all atrocities deliberately and freely. I feel no regret; but seeing the futility of our ambitions, I feel incredibly tired and disgusted by our trivial ways. Perhaps I have outlived the timespan I can endure. With stolen life-force and dreams I prolonged my life for so long that I often cannot tell what really happened and what I might have imagined, or what is a lie told so often and casually that I forgot the truth. While I watch the newest bid for power of my people, I write this down to tell the people of other times about what happened here.\nWhile I feel that the recent plans of my people will not play out well, I think they will add to all the futility in my lifetime and our people\u2019s, and that whatever happened here will be completely forgotten to all but the uncaring gods and, perhaps, some of our surviving enemies. I write this down in the tongue of the gods, hoping that their vanity alone is enough to ensure that this gift to their followers be preserved. I write this down on mere paper instead of using the dream crystals of my people. This way it might escape the watchful eyes of my colleagues long enough to outlive them.\nMuch could be told about my people. It would fill volumes and yet only scratch the surface. But this is nothing I could accomplish at all, and nothing I'd even care to try. If I am right, my people will be dead soon enough and just another side note of history. I somewhat relish the thought that we will be the subject of speculation and myth, so it suits me well that those who will come after us are not too familiar with our doings in history. That being said, a few things should be mentioned just in case we are completely wiped out from not only existence, but history as well.\nFirst of all, the name of my people is nothing meant for vocal chords. It is a thought pattern, half a dream and untranslatable into any tongue.\nAs is the language we use with our own people. It was a hard thing to learn to communicate with others. It is somewhat disgusting , having to rely on grunting and gasping to communicate with our allies. The latter gave us many names, rarely though to flatter us. Dreamstealers, dreamvampires, dreamshapers and so many, many more that I've forgotten them. Most of the times I preferred to refer to us simply as the dreamers."

We were no great warriors, but we served in our own ways in the god wars. In the service of the gods, we helped those allied to Zathroth. We were spies, messengers, advisors; and we manufactured weapons of war in our own, special way. I was one of the first. A leader, a priest, a prophet. Yet I always let others do the outstanding things. I fancied pulling strings and being the secret initiator of many things; but I'm not sure now how much of this is true or some kind of paltry excuse I convinced myself to believe. All the great achievements of our race were initiated by others.  But I have been there, and outlived them all. Early on, my people developed a mastery of dream, unparalleled before. We shaped dreams, and dragged them into reality. We constructed dreams, with the only purpose to use them as facilities to forge other dreams in them. The concept has become so natural and trivial to me that it is hard to explain. It is like explaining colours to a blind man.\nSuffice it to say that we used dreams, both self-made and stolen, to shape the world and provide us with shelter, sustenance, tools and weapons. Dreams soon became the currency and life blood of our society. We were never numerous though, and managed to convince the leaders of our side that we were too valuable to be wasted on the battlefield. So we dwelled in our city made of stolen dreams, and schemed. Sometimes against our mutual foe, sometimes against our allies, and sometimes within our own. For several centuries this kept me occupied and entertained. We built the great dream catcher, our greatest accomplishment. A monument of our power. With its might, incomprehensible to people bound only to one world, our might was amplified in unimaginable ways. We rose in power, higher and higher; rivalling that of Zathroth\u2019s favourite pets, the demons. This led to a few clashes between them and us. We managed to hold our own until now; and this is what probably will lead to our downfall.\nA short while ago, the council was approached with the request that we use the arts of our race to construct something entirely new: a prison made of dreams, using the veils and barriers of other worlds to dampen the power of all creatures, and lock them in and torture them for all eternity. We did not question this request. It was much too tempting to grow even more powerful, and so we consented. Little did we know that everything was staged and we were purposely misled."

        "text": "My people dived into this new venture with ambition. Resources were sent by other races, even knowledge was reluctantly shared by them. Prisoners and renegades were sent to us to do tests and experiments with them. Little of what we requested was ever denied. Even I was mildly thrilled for a while by the sheer novelty of the enterprise.\nThen strange things began to happen. Plans were slightly changed, requests added to projects and the advisors led certain researches onto different paths that were not agreed upon. I would not have lived that long if I had not developed a sense for things going amiss. It became more and more obvious that we were not aware of the full truth. The increase of power levels for the prisons, for example, had, step by step, risen enormously. These were no longer prisons meant for some minor captives - these prisons were powerful enough to even give a lesser god some trouble. And there was more. Additions brought in by other races, things we did not even understand, were added. More and more demon 'advisors' stayed in the city all the while we heard about an increased fierceness of the battles elsewhere. I knew something big was happening. I was just undecided what to do with the knowledge. My first impulse was to run and hide, to watch from safety. But then I realised how tired I was of scheming and hiding. Yes, this was new, not home-made as usual; but for all its novelty it was still the same. I decided not to run but to stay and watch, and face what might come.\nSoon I was more and more convinced that I was right; and when some of the demons approached us for a secret meeting, I was only mildly curious about what might be revealed. However, I can't tell what happened then and there. Gods were involved and binding vows were spoken, so that even now I can't go into details. I can merely circumvent it through stating that most of the secret things spoken about have already happened by now and are common knowledge.\nI had been right that the prison was more than just that. It was meant to be a trap. And it was meant not primarily for our enemies, but our allies. Well, at least for the traitors amongst them. And who the traitors were, well, that was earth-shaking news."

        "text": "A cadre of the most powerful demon princes in existence, actually all of them, were declared traitors. Seemingly they had not defected to the enemy but a third power, of which nothing was related. All we had to know was that we had to take out the most formidable force on our own side. The sheer power of these beings had always been something we feared and coveted. We were assured we would have all the assistance that we could. We would be supported by the next finest batch of demons at the disposal of our gods. I was sceptical that the pupils of the very creatures we planned to capture might be of any help. But we were assured of their loyalty. Much of the plan and its detail were based on a wretched thing of a demon who called himself Bazir. This Bazir and his about two dozens allies were handpicked from the demon armies; chosen for their diverse talents and unwavering loyalty - and very probably for their lust to replace their former masters.\nWe could do nothing but comply. In this stage, no one could have walked out in possession of such information and just stayed out of the whole thing. Now we were bound. Bound to an uneasy alliance at best. We had always competed with the demons; we never were close friends and in certain areas too similar to get along with each other at all. But we needed their magic, their knowledge, their sheer power for the trap to work.\nEven while we were talking about what we had just learned, my people began to plot and scheme. I kept quiet. I could imagine the demons we just allied with a few moments ago doing the very same thing, at the very same time. That was when I knew we were all doomed. Not one of us was going to get out of this alive. Treachery was so natural to us and our allies that there was no other way, no other possibility.\nThe weight of stolen centuries and cycles of treachery almost crushed me when I first realised this.\nThe sweet thing was that the ever-turning wheel was about to break, that all would finally come to an end. That was why I stayed, in the end. \nI stayed to await the end of all things that I knew. I might have had a faint hope of escaping the catastrophe, that something new and fresh would rise out of the ashes, and that I could be part of it.\nBut in my heart I knew that I would never be fresh and new. I would always be the same old dreamer, trapped in cycles of schemes and treachery.\nHowever, things progressed impressively. With the knowledge of the demons and plenty of fresh test subjects, we made advances unhoped for.\nThe whole thing sometimes frightened even me; this trap, the only way to take these entities out without losing legions and opening a gap for our enemies.\nThen the day came."

And we were prepared to let the trap spring. Of course we suspected treachery and double-crossing. I knew the plans to secure the remaining allied demons in other, secretly built prisons. They would be as weak and vulnerable as never before. With the princes gone and their most powerful loyalist demons taken out, we would rule undisputed. After all, we held the keys to the prisons.\nOf course the other side plotted, too. My people were so engrossed in their own schemes they ignored the possibility that the plans of their rivals might be as dangerous as their own.\nThey were wrong to do so, of course.\nWhen the trap was sprung - the oaths even now prevent me to go into details - the demons did not show up at all. I had never trusted this Bazir, but I thought that at least some of the others, more furious like Apocalypse, Lurin, Infernatil and Vazrok, would be too eager to test their might, to hold back.\nThe first prince was caught completely unaware when the trap sprang. This was almost too easy. But then, hell broke loose - literally. Our nightmare creatures were no match for the princes and their retinue. They were so powerful! We had kept ourselves out of most direct battles of the war and were completely unprepared for such a display of power and cruelty. Within seconds all seemed lost, when the demons finally intervened, obviously in panic that everything was at stake now.\nBut it was almost too late. The princes had cut a good part of my people into pieces and alarmed their minions in the city. There was slaughter everywhere.\nI saw demons being ripped apart by the princes. Sheldrax and Ashfalor were both shredded to pieces before my very eyes by Sephorath, prince of agony. Several parts of one of the demons crawled away, obviously animated by some magic to preserve its life; but there was hardly anything left to be preserved.\nTulax the mighty, Jebborn, Semir, they all fell like flies swatted away.\nHere and there, a prince succumbed to the sheer number of allied forces; but the fight looked desperate for our side.\nThen the great nightmare beasts were unleashed. Though not truly rivalling a prince in power, still they were unknown to them and hard to defeat. Although no match in a direct confrontation, they managed to distract them long enough for some of us to desperately unleash all the stolen dreams from the dream catcher.\nAll our wealth, the essence of our existence and the harvest of centuries, blown away in less than a minute.\nBut the devastation on mind and body was enormous. Everyone caught in the blast was weakened if not unconscious. I saw the minds of several people I had known for years as rivals go blank forever.\nI was blind, too. Not only physically, but also mentally.\nWhen mind and sight became clear again, a considerable time had passed."

Demons who had previously fled the carnage caused by the princes closed in, like Zitraks smelling blood. They swarmed over the fallen princes with ravenous force.\nNot more than ten or so of our treacherous allies had survived the slaughter, but their minions were seemingly in endless supply. I had not been aware they had brought so much backup forces into our city.\nI was confused. Still I could not feel anything and stumbled through the streets that were distorted by what I imagined a storm of unbound dreams. \nWhen I found shelter, the sound of battle in the city already grew fainter.\nI looked down to see that my body was mutilated and my life force sapping out. But that was something I welcomed.\nMy tiredness in mind is now shared with this body. I would not create a new one, even if I could.\nI will allow things to run their course. I will sink into the eternal dream.\nTo finally let go.\nOnce again be one with the dreams, riding above the plains of nightmare on the howling winds.\nIt is so long ago that I have done that.\nThere was always something to do, something to take care of, an ambition to be fulfilled.\nIf I'd only had dreamed a bit more. Instead of chasing goals that were not even mine.\nEverything is futile.\nBut this is not.\nI imagine this text will survive the ravages of time.

The council advised prudence, to stay vigilant as we always have. The head seems to want the contrary. In the time between this meeting and the last, he ordered to built at least two additional forges already and demanded Cannos to copy all of our previous records at least twice. It's not manageable anymore, I already contacted one of my suppliers but it's just not possible to press any harder. Furthermore, it does not look like this dispute is going to end well, the council will not have anymore of these escapades. As was evident by several open remarks or to quote Sentif: \"If headmaster Dolis conceits himself to be some kind of benevolent autocrat, that's fine but that would also mean the end of his role as the head of this society. We are not a... (loud interjections) ... please, we are not a royal household, Dolis is not a king and this is certainly not a war! (louder and impertinent interjections)\".\nThe general consent was that if Dolis continues to press the research, the council will be forced to take steps. The headmaster defended himself, and I quote: \"We do not yet know what awaits us and we cannot afford to take this lightly. The more we know about the this entity, the better and the faster we learn, the safer we can sleep. (very loud and sometimes mocking remarks, several rebukes from council-members towards the audience) We have evidence that (laughter) ... evidence that this being is sentient and watching us - but for how long? It may be watching us, following our every word, every snide remark of yours and everything we plan - right now! (abrupt silence in the audience, the headmaster paused). Now, I will bow to the council but you cannot stop me in taking my own precautions. In the interest of this whole society and everyone's future we try to protect, we have to contain the Planestrider. (Dolis leaves, the council members jump from their seats with harsh remarks, the audience bursts into loud discussions).\nPersonal comment: the Head Planegazer is growing weary of waiting, he demands results. His reckless behaviour will endanger the whole society as well as himself. He could jeopardise everything including everyone's safety, he so valiantly tries to protect. We can only hope he will abide to the will of the council. We all share a common goal, this is no group you can just leave, nor can we put any reprisals on our members. Our credo is to prevent panic, not to give it more room. \"Canvas your knowledge, veil the end.\" Dolis should remember what this is all about.\nPreliminaries: I will talk to forgemaster Logur to continue analysing the replicas and enhance our equipment. We will see what we can do but it's not possible to go any faster, we're working day an night as it is."

With the lack of the enemy's discipline, their ranks were lacking any cohesive formation and our forces could push through to inflict massive damage. Our vanguard managed to identify some individuals that would be called leaders in armies that are more formal. They even cornered one of them and under heavy casualties wounded them severely which forced them to retreat. Sadly the remaining vanguard got cut off from our forces in the fight and was completely wiped out by the enemy forces."

Whether the enemy is gathering new forces or waiting for new orders, now is the time to act. We have to use that little breathing space we won by fighting back to bring the battle to the enemy. The gnomes managed to gain vital intelligence on the enemy and we made our own observations in the fights. The major figures on the hostile side are seemingly several leaders that, aside from being a lethal threat on their own, served as some kind of rallying spot for the enemies armies.\nA certain three of them have been identified as crucial for the efforts of 'those below'.\nLacking proper alternative names the boys have named the incomprehensible creatures after likewise incomprehensible titles of human nobility. They are identified as the Count of the Core, the Duke of the Depths and the Baron from Below. As long as we can put enough pressure on them, the attacks might be kept at a manageable rate. It is vital though, that we strike soon and strike hard.\nThere are several more formidable creatures in the ranks of the enemy but they seem more like loners and encounters with them are rare. It seems wise to avoid them when possible and let special strike teams handle them if the need arises.\nGiven that the gnomes are more familiar with the enemy, it might be possible that they are not exaggerating when they claim that the enemy is prepared to utilise even worse methods to annihilate our defences. If they are right, the enemy plans to flood our tunnels with lava and that is a threat no axe nor steel could hope to fight."

They did surprisingly well - until they got into the inevitable mess we expected. Since they stubbornly insisted to remain in the midst of trouble, we had to come to their rescue of course. The dwarves proved astonishingly capable in fighting the threat but in the long run they would have succumbed to the constant onslaught unless we brought in our ingenuity and expertise. Since the dwarves were somewhat reluctant to let go of their proven tactics, we had to figure out how to reinforce them in the best way possible. Naturally we came up with some solutions that fused our expertise and equipment with those of the dwarves to a solid defence. \nNow we seem somewhat stuck in the fight, no side gaining the upper hand. Experience tells us, however, that those below won't be idle for long and the next waves of attacks will be more fierce and long. Eventually even the best defences will wear off.\nFurthermore, our sources tell us that the real threat is even more sinister. We located several sources of tremendous heat in the depths. We encountered something like that some time before: it always preceded the rise and eruption of large lava steams into a confined cave system. It seems that our old enemy is using old tricks once again. The location of the heat sources seems easy enough, yet to get to them and possibly destroy the mechanisms they use to raise the lava is the hard part.\nWe do agree with the dwarves that only swift and decisive action can win the day. We have to strike at the heart of the invasion force."

If we find the origin of the cubes, we find the origin of this being itself. Yet all the cubes we found so far seem incomplete.\n(extensive maps may have been drawn here, time has rendered them completely unreadable, what is still there seems to not make much sense)\nComments on active projects:\n(the first 20 or so notes are mostly uninteresting and common observations)\n#26: Dimensional Beings\nWe found evidence of what we assume to be visitors from another dimension. A whole race of interdimensional beings has been traced to an uncharted and unexplored content approximately far to the north-east. Travellers have confirmed sightings of hideous creatures with multiple lags, mouths and eyes, devouring or carrying large amounts of energy. All reports described very unnatural beings appearing out of nowhere.\n#26/2,addendum: Successful Capture\nOne specimen was found bound and half-dead on a ship. The captain abandoned the remainder of his crew on this floating coffin only shortly after it arrived in the Venore harbour so we do not know who captured it or how it got onto the ship. It must have been a truly daunting task, however, for as we tried to pull it out of the ship's hold, it came alive and started attacking us immediately, causing a lot of damage. We managed to contain it using one of the advanced holding cells our craftsmen designed. Studying this thing may bring us one step closer to the truth. What are these things and are they the origin of all this?\n#26/3,addendum: One Step Back\nWhile we can confirm the specimen from 26/2 is not from our dimension, it is not in any way connected to the being we're after. I conclude that the Planestrider may not even be a \"being\" in the actual sense. All things considered it may be more of a \"concept\" but to what end? What is the purpose and why this trail of unmistakable evidence on its existence? The words it offers us are a part of something it wants us to know. It must all be connected to form a meaning, a message. It is clear that we are close to decipher it but what if it is not even in our hands anymore, what if it never was?

        "text": "Those Below, What We Know (I)\nSince the enemy that we know as 'those below' seem to only act through vassals, it is hard to say when they were encountered first. Seemingly random events in the past might have been more or less their doing unbeknown to anyone. In the light of recent events theories have spread that link disasters of the past and monster incursions to the doings of 'those below'. In fact, since no one was expecting a guiding hand behind those events, there is no evidence to support that. The great cave-in of the starsilver claim is cited the most amongst such instances. Indeed the few tunnels that remain from these mines are overrun by creatures that are counted to the forces of those below. Still, it's possible that they are simply lured by seismic activity and just moved in. The gnomes were the first to make out patterns in certain events and attacks on their deepest hold. When their counter efforts were met in kind and often countered, they began to suspect a guiding force behind all of this. Their concentrated efforts were answered by massive counterblows that required massive coordination and logistics, not available to the mostly primitive creatures they fought. Even countermeasures against cave-ins and volcanic activity were sabotaged. Despite all gnomish efforts the enemy activity just grew until the gnomes had to pull back when the effort and casualties were no longer worth the gain from those bases. At first only random holds in the deepest of regions were lost. The frequency of occurrences did rise and at some point establishing new outposts did no longer cover up the losses. The gnomes retreated from the deeper areas and put more efforts into new bases closer to the surface to compensate. With their somewhat nomadic lifestyle the gnomes were able to handle the new situation quite well but since the threat is spreading more and more, they see themselves under pressure. With the deep mining on the rise for the last several hundred years, the dwarfish forces on the other hand are beginning to encounter more and more of the minions from below on their own. Mining technology that was safe and reliable for millennia have started to fail, due to the unnatural seismic activity and rise of lava levels."

Especially since behind the enemy's frontline the earth temperature is rising at an alarming rate and former deep territory that was once settled by gnomes is now immersed by lava. It seems that whatever is leading the attacks is living behind or even in that lava.\nWe do know that the enemy makes use of numerous creatures. Often the creatures they control are commonly dangerous but rare and display far less aggressive behaviour. They don't gather in hordes, let alone they'd attack with any coordination or in league with other creatures. It is unknown how exactly those creatures are controlled or guided but there seems to be a connection to the mighty leader-like creatures they employ amongst their minions. If they are eliminated, coordination and aggressiveness levels drop almost immediately.\nThe fact that a lost tribe of dwarves has been enslaved and bred for war purposes hints how they might have attained control over other subterranean races, sentient or not. There is strong evidence that they actually breed their minions actively and there is some sort of indoctrination involved. Given that they breed the lost dwarves to creatures of low intelligence and high aggressiveness, it is likely they have similar procedures for other creatures as well.\nTheir choice of generals gives other hints abut heir nature. In at least one case they employ the assistance of a fallen gnome. His mind and body were heavily altered in unknown ways. Though in charge of leading their troops he displayed behaviour that usually would be considered mad. Also even he was somehow linked to the coordination of the hostile forces. Although as a gnome he didn't previously display any kind of telepathic ability. So it can be assumed that the other so called generals they employ are also heavily altered specimens of their kind. They probably don't resemble the appearance of 'those below' which leaves us with no clue how they look."

        "text": "Those Below, What We Know (III)\nThe only enemies that could be captured and questioned were some of the lost. They displayed a tremendous pain tolerance and lack of fear but their intelligence levels seemed seemingly frighteningly low. With limited vocabulary and interaction it seemed that they see 'those below' rather as some form of primal gods of fire and pain than as creatures. It seems likely they never saw or interacted with them directly.\nConquered territory saw an increase of heat levels. This went hand in hand with the level of occupation of the territory. Where they could be repelled, the heat level did not rise significantly, so a natural cause can be ruled out. What is unknown is if the heat comes with the presence of those below or they need it to move into an area and raise it in some way.\nThe nature of 'those below' still remains an enigma. From the little we know only some assumptions can be made. They seem to need or enjoy extreme heat levels and they actively expand their territory, not accepting or attempting any form of negotiation. Their minions behave and communicate (as little it may be) in an entirely enigmatic and alien way so that the reasoning and thinking of 'those below' can't easily be predicted.\nThe need to spread their territory hints at a rather numerous race that constantly needs more room or resources.\nThe dominance over powerful beings they employ as generals points at an immense personal power level of the individuals or the race as a whole.\nThey can manipulate and transform individual beings somehow, perhaps even for breeding those transformations into species.\nTheir minions, like the lost, require crude, self-made weapons that rather rely on the little skill that race has left than outside sources. Other forms of equipment, as few as have been found so far, hint at even more alien origins and are dissimilar to commonly known tools or machinery. Even those objects, however, might be the remainder of a craft that one of their subjugated minion races once possessed and is probably only a mere shadow of the craftsmanship those races were previously capable of.\nTheir forces show no regard to themselves or others. A retreat can only be enforced when they deem an effort no longer viable. What is viable or not follows no discernible pattern. Whereas sometimes a brimming ore mine was left in peace after a rag and tag band of defenders fended off some invaders, they sacrificed legions of minions to conquer some abandoned cave, far away from anything of importance.\nIn this state of the war it has to be mentioned that 'those below', their origin, their look and their motives continue to be an enigma. As their attacks and the pressure they put on other races rises, the importance of such information becomes more and more a priority. How this information can be acquired though, is still something that is desperately debated upon."

He seems a rather shy and reclusive boy. We had not the chance to talk much to him but if it were not for his advisors, the brothers Wisbert and Madol, the heads of the church of Uman and Zathroth respectively, I'd fear for the wellbeing of the realm. The boy seems pale and unhealthy. He had obvious problems to follow any conversation and word at the court is that the untimely death of his father made the boy even more timid then he was before. We were assured though, that the council of nobles and the two grand priests of the both most influential churches were guiding him and leading his hand. The brothers Wisbert and Madol were indeed impressive men of wisdom and charisma. Their eloquence was almost intimidating and beyond their calm demeanor I sensed some kind of animosity between them. Perhaps it was just their way though and their witty remarks and retorts fooled me. They are brothers after all. Both are men with vision though and when they both fully agreed on how our realm should handle the challenges ahead I'm confident these brilliant men will grant security and stability for our beloved country.\nI also visited the royal stables and let me tell you, that you'd might be in for a nice surprise when I return home.\nCount Allstio sends his regards. He feels sorry that he won't be able to attend our summer feast but he'll be on an expedition to some foreign land by then. You know Allstio and how secretive he can be (I even heard he built some sort of cryptlike retreat in that awful Greenclaw Swamp) so this is all of information I can offer you.\nI hope you and the kids are well,\nyours,\nDargen"

Some of them might be discarded as fairy tales (of course not in the opinions of the dwarfs), but I dare to say that most of them are true. There is one kind of story which you can hear by all kind of dwarven tribes, all describing the same things. These stories tell about some vast structures underground that seem to be the remains of an ancient civilisation. The long-abandoned structures in these stories share striking similarities. Oddly, these structures are found at places in totally different environments and often also far away from each other. Some widely travelled dwarfs claim to have seen similar things in remote continents and isles. Sometimes only a few bricks at some odd place hint at one of these ancient structures. Others, however, are well preserved ruins in which even some rooms are still recognisable. Obviously, the ancient race that once lived in these structures had colonies all over the known world. Some theories try to link these structures to the extinct Morad race - a race of nomadic builders that supposedly left their traces all over the world. The recent researches of Fordworth, though, seem to prove that the Morad used a fast growing crystal substance for their buildings. These crystals, however, only lasted for a dozen years. So nothing the Morad had built would have endured until today. If we compare the aforementioned dwarven records with those of several dungeon crawling adventurers, however, we learn that some of these ruins, sometimes separated by continents, were inhabited by a brutish race of savages. It seems likely that whoever built those structures brought these creatures with them to serve as guardians and workers. When the creators abandoned their structures, they left their servants behind. They, however, were unable to maintain them properly. But who are the ones that built these structures? It seems unlikely that there was another nomad race. Why would they leave their servants behind when moving to another location? My theory is that the structures were used to gather resources. Just like the dwarfs, this race sent out many prospectors to look for a specific resource. Whenever they encountered a vein, they stationed some constructors and their workers. Since there are still workers left at some of these places, the race must have abandoned them in a haste. This of course suggests that valuable information and artefacts might have been left, too, some of them probably in the hands of these brutish workers. This is certainly worth an expedition. If I were to find a sponsor, I would helm an expedition of my own into the depths of Tibia."

You need to accumulate some critical mass of synergistic energy and open a rift between the worlds. The needed ingredients consist of some of the negative energy that is similar to the essence of the demonic realm.\nThe first part of the summoning ritual opens only a small rift to the demonic realm. Through this rift demonic energy enters into our world infiltrating into the ingredients and filling them with more power. With stronger ingredients, the ritual opens a larger rift this time, letting more demonic energy in to strengthen the ingredients. This ritual is repeated over and over again until the ingredients are strong enough to open a portal through which the demons can pass.\nThis ritual can also be initiated from the demon side. Sightings of Orshabaal and similar entities clearly show all characteristics common for such rituals.\nOnce the gate is open, demonic minions appear and boost the negative energy of the place by their sheer presence. Later, the demonic master is following. His appearance causes a drop of the negative energy as the demon lord is feeding on it to sustain his existence in our realm.\nAs long as there are enough minions to boost the negative energy of a place, demons can exist for a very long time in our realm. So in theory, it would also be possible that the gate between the two realms is kept open, allowing more and more demons to enter our world that can easily form a demonic army causing mayhem and havoc."

        "text": "The Complete and Unabridged Story of the Three Wizards\nThe Wizards were friends once. They still are, in a way... however, they are always arguing, complaining about each other and trying to outsmart each other whenever possible. Each of them basically has the exact same qualifications, goals and methods, but in completely different areas.\nBefore this time of unending quarrel, they were all working together on a complex experiment. Its goal was to create an ever-burning source of energy, fluid magic concentrated in a gigantic vessel. Ultimate, pure and self-replenishing power. They combined their talents and unique features, working together as a whole. Fern of Nature drew unfathomable amounts of energy from the life roots of the world, channelling all forms of energy created by living, moving things and even nature itself to Furb. Furb of Fun created a magic device, capable of conducting this stream of force to Feiz. Feiz was bending the planes of time and the laws of the whole physical realm of Tibia to form and sustain the vessel. The combined might of three highly trained and completely focussed wizards, who spent almost all their life concentrating on this single purpose, was necessary to keep this power at bay.\nThere were days of doubt, however. Days of recreation, days of training and focus. Days when they were weak and felt broken, even destroyed. It was on one of those days when they were first contacted by Carlotta. The wizards did not cherish many contacts to the world of men. Living high above in a small realm of their own magic, host to the clouds and secluded from even the eyes of dragons, they did not exactly get out much. When they learned about a fellow sorceress by the name of Carlotta, who somehow found out about what they were doing and who wanted to take part, they were actually enraged, even angry. As they saw no harm in what they were doing, however, they did not see any threat to their work in a person who suddenly took their plans seriously. Still, they were reluctant and turned her help down.\nThat was when Fern received a more... personal letter from Carlotta. The author of this story does not know the content of these writings, the consequences, however, are crucial to this tale. The problem was, Furb did not receive such a letter - neither did Feiz. When a second, a third and several more letters arrived, Fern had already stopped opening them in front of the others. And he wrote back. Their focus weakened.\nAs the weeks passed by, the results of their efforts were more often than not unsatisfactory. Around this time, the letters to Fern stopped. Fern never said a thing to the others. The project went on.\nEverything went smoothly until Furb received a present. From Carlotta. Fern had never received anything else than written words. He would have even understood Carlotta turning to Furb for one reason or another, but a complete set of unique Zaoan jade figures changed everything. Fern loved Zaoan chess. He was heartbroken when he saw Furb playing with what was rightfully his. And Furb was writing letters now. Their focus weakened again. Furb and Fern were literally competing about even the smallest component of their everyday life. Finding out who was actually worthy of the sorceress changed their ways fundamentally.\nWhen the project reached a critical state, Feiz cut the connection to the outside world completely. Isolated and in complete dismay, they continued.\nThey did not hear of Carlotta again. The experiment failed. Feiz' remarks about losing grip because of petty differences over the teasings of a woman made all three of them rivals. They now spend their time creating tests, riddles and even competitions to let the outside world decide what they, in all their equality, cannot.\nWhat happened to Carlotta? Will the three ever declare a winner? And who is that distant relative Feiz suddenly has to visit from time to time?"

        "text": "The Origin of Vampires\nSince the vampiric curse is spread through infectious bites, many vampires know only little about the origin of their kind. Then again the longevity or even immortality of vampires makes it possible that they have even existed before the creation of mankind.\nOf course such beasts are hard to capture and they do not like to share their knowledge. Even if you are lucky enough to be able to talk to one, you cannot be sure if he is telling the truth. In fact, most questioned subjects were making up stories and boasted about their importance, age and accomplishments.\nLacking historical knowledge, such individuals can usually be cornered by accurate historical questions. This leaves a few sources that can be seen as credible to some extent. Still, their reports are diverse and share only a few facts. These common facts are the most reliable information we have these days.\nThe vampires claim that the eldest of their kin still remember a time when humankind was still divided in nomadic tribes that suffered in the wars of the gods. Some see this as a reference that the creation of the first vampires took place before the Corpse War.\nThe majority of vampires agreed that there was only one shrouded forefather vampire, though few mention also a small coven from which the vampire plague was initiated. The most reliable sources tell about some 'lost kingdom' where the first vampires ruled over a herd of humans that they treated like cattle.\nAt some point in history, the younger vampires rebelled against the elders who suppressed them. Others claim the rebellion took place to gain power in this static aristocracy in which the older vampires would have never made room for the next generation due to being near to immortal. It is unknown which side won. In fact the discrepancies in the single stories are so large that we assume that the vampires themselves are unsure about the happenings in these obviously chaotic days. Some claim the rebels won and chased the aristocracy away, others say the ruling cast won and met the rebels with such brute force that the few survivors could only flee. Then again there are stories that the fight between the vampires awakened something evil which drove the surviving combatants off their once safe haven. A few stories even claim that the humans used this opportunity to rebel against their cruel oppressors.\nThere are no hints about the location of this lost vampire kingdom. It is assumed that it was somewhere overseas, though. Some historians suggest Edron, but, the ruins in Edron are said to origin from much earlier times. Others assume it might have been on the mysterious continent Darama, either in Drefia or in Ankrahmun. However, the destruction of Drefia took place much later and there were no reports about undead activity, except for the works of several local necromancers, before this time. Ankrahmun, on the other hand, has a very accurate historical library and there is no such thing like a vampire kingdom mentioned at all."

They must not collide with the ship. Each collision will add one destruction point to the ship. If a certain amount of destruction points has been reached, the mission fails.\nAdditionally, the spectral core of the ship is located on the upper deck. Due to the strains of your journey, it will take damage at random times. If it is 'killed', the ship will take a significant amount of destruction points which will almost certainly lead to a failure of the voyage.\nOn the middle deck, the spiritual movement and energy source are located. The ship gains energy by discharging elemental forces that have to be brought to the corresponding elemental shrines. When someone approaches the purple flame, he will be charged with a certain elemental energy and change his appearance accordingly, though only for a limited time. This person has to reach the corresponding shrine and use it to discharge his energy. This will revitalise the purple flame. If the purple flame ever goes out, the ship will take considerable damage. Avoid the spectral vortexes and the grates. They will discharge you of elemental energy or confuse you temporarily. The flames will hurt you but neither stop nor discharge you. Sometimes sloth wraiths will spawn that can slow you down considerably. They are invulnerable but will disappear when lured on a spectral vortex.\nOn the lowest deck of the ship, you will find an emergency kit and a ghost duster. Both items are ESSENTIAL for your task. The appointed people should take them as quickly as possible.\nOn the lowest deck, ghost rats will spawn constantly. Use your ghost duster to destroy the rats. The rats' gnawing will occasionally destroy parts of the floor. The floor is destroyed in several stages. As long as no water is leaking, someone with an emergency kit can fix the holes,  though the rats are able to gnaw through the fixed spot again. Each floor tile through which water is leaking will add destruction points to the ship. It is advised that one person uses the ghost duster and another the emergency kit, although groups may decide that they might need some more help on one of the other decks.\nThe journey will end with a failure once the ship has reached a certain amount of destruction points, or with success if the limit of destruction points has not been reached after a given period of time."

Hastily but in secrecy the first Inquisition was formed under the helmsmanship of grand priest Wisbert from the temple of Uman who was chief advisor of the uncrowned, 15 year old Rodmund. The traitorous elements were exposed and routed out. In the whole land Zathroth's temples were seized and the conspiring priesthood put in jail. Interrogations by the Inquisition unearthed the massive extent of the treachery and the church of Zathroth fell in irredeemable disgrace with the crown. Within a year under the guidance of Wisbert, the Purger, the worship of Zathroth was forbidden in the whole realm and their temples where destroyed or cleansed and reclaimed by the churches of the other gods. The grand priest of Zathroth, Madol, the Defiler, was burned at the stake, north of Thais. Even after his coronation in the year after the purge had begun, king Rodmund II had to live reclusive and under the vigilance of the Inquisition and the church of Banor since several attempts on his live were made by remaining Zathroth cultists. To honor his efforts and wisdom, Wisbert was named chancelor of the realm. In his tireless efforts he spearheaded the purge and managed to rout out several traitorous nobles that were in league with the Zathrothi. In his renewal and healing of the realm, a significant amount of lesser but pious houses were elevated to positions of honor and influence and the realm prospered by their wise, divine inspired guidance in the years to come."

The answer is simple: Hell! And who rules hell? Satan! So, obviously Satan is the cause of these movements, Satan is among us all the time.

I indeed believe there was once a powerful lone dragon who was the first of all. He wandered our world thousands of years ago and then disappeared. Was it Garsharak himself? Or was it his first child? Has this ancient creature really left this world or is it still there, hiding somewhere, perhaps sleeping, perhaps waiting? These questions preyed on my mind for many a year. Finally, when I joined the Explorer Society, I decided to do my own research. I visited many libraries all over Tibia and studied many books. I travelled to remote and dangerous places to do excavations. But I never found the smallest hint that the First Dragon ever existed. I was ready to give up, I just wanted to visit just one last site. And incredibly, I discovered something! An ancient inscription, nearly invisible, buried in the walls of this small cave underneath Thais. I uncovered it and began to translate the old runes which had been used centuries ago. Only single fragments are still readable:\n\"... First Dragon ... thousands ... ago. ... four descendants ... different kinds of dragons. ... Gelidrazah, Taz... disappeared. ... cemetery? Or ... Yal...? ... trials ... incitements in order to find the lairs of ...\"\nIt is very hard to translate the heavily weathered inscription.

Some of them were wounded, some not. All were deadly tired. They had to escape from a hord of orcs, a whole tribe with more then 35 fighters. Late in the night, they came to a huge bridge, or at least the rest of a once mighty bridge. It was small and seemed to be not very save. The sorcerer screamed some loud and mighty words and for a second the bridge glew in a blue light.\n\"I see\" the sorcerer said, \"that this bridge will break down and fall into the water within 60 minutes. So we have to hurry up. It will only hold two of us at the same time and it is a long bridge. The wounded knight will need 25 minutes to go over the bridge, and it will take me 20. The paladin can go faster, so he will be on the other side within 10 minutes.\"\nPointing at the druid he said: \"And you can use your spell to move faster. You will need only 5 minutes.\"\n\"Ok then, let\u00b4s go! Don\u00b4t waste time\" shouted the knight and started to go. But then he stopped. \"I can\u00b4t see anything. The bridge is dangerous. We will need your magic light wand to cross it. Without light we will fall down in the cold and deep water. So always someone has to return to bring back the wand of light to the others.\"\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked the paladin \"How can we all reach the other side before the evil orcs will get us? I have no arrow left and we can\u00b4t fight them! In which order we have to pass the bridge? Who should go first?\" The druid started to grumbel: \"Let me say k for knight, d for druid, s for sorcerer, p for paladin. hmmm.... and now let me thing:\ndk-d-dp-\nand hmmmm nonono.\nHmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\"\n\"Got it!\" the sorcerer screamed. \"Let\u00b4s run!\""

I am aware of the smugglers' usefulness and their role in our plans, but their unreliability is a constant threat to us. Of course they have no idea what we are doing here but they are curious and would sell their own grandmother for a mug of ale. Perhaps we could simply replace them with more trustworthy followers. Not all are that suitable as asassins or agitators but all of them are able to follow orders and how difficult can it be to do some smuggling. Yet, the superiors insist that their contacts are needed.

The first reports about his activities date back to the pirate conflict that threatened the Venore merchants council. Noxious obviously was hired along with other mercenaries to get rid of some pirate captains that held the usually unorganised pirates under their control. Altough there are no specifics about the affair, Ned Noxious was the only one, out of of the twelve hired mercenaries, that returned to claim his reward. Afterwards he was employed by different persons or groups for undocumented and rather insignificant jobs. His next notable apperance was the elimination of the bandit queen Leerah within her own camp full of renegade amazons. It is assumed that Noxious used invisibility to get to her and quickly killed her before any guards could react.\nFurther accomplishments that are probably related to him:\nThe assassination of the last Thaian mayor of Venore.\nThe assassination of the mage Haramun in Darashia.\nThe assassination of the Mixton Family.\nThe sabotage of the 'Queen Torviva' in the harbor of Carlin.\nThe poisoning of the Edron wells which led to five deaths.\nThe killing of at least six noblemen in provoked duels.\nWe cannot be sure for which felonies he was paid by an unknown party and which of these acts he fulfilled out of sheer morbid pleasure. Still the lack of any proof makes it impossible to punish him adequately.\nAt least three assassination attempts on him have already failed."

If we spread our risk, we would also spread our resources. The agitators, as you call them, are only useful if also trained as assassins. It is more useful to pick some promising students and teach them elocution and manipulation. If someone proves unsuitable,  we can simply put him back into normal training. If we had two bases, the risk that possible captives know about them both is high enough to diminish the advantage of another base to zero. Rest assured that we are aware of the danger of the base being assaulted. You know that in such a case it is your job to destroy anything that could point to us and escape on your own. Those whose training was good enough to be of any value for us will be able to escape on their own and will be contacted and informed at places that were allotted to them for cases of emergeny."

Yet, their skills in charging items with magical energy must have been of some value to the others. It seems they prospered for a while, selling their craft. At some point though, the other races decided to take what they needed by force and thereby destroyed the entire race. Some texts hint that the Shapers preferred to sacrifice themselves and to detonate their forges, rather than letting them fall into the hands of others. Other forges were destroyed when trying to lift their secrets. Again others were dismantled by Shapers in order to protect them from the wrong hands. Some were simply stolen, only to learn that all but the simplest of them had stopped working. As for the Astral Shapers, they were used by their captors as some kind of magical truffle pig for a while. However, since their spirit was broken, the race as such perished and eventually died out."

        "text": "The Ferumbras Files\nThe followers of Ferumbras believe that in his early career, the ambitious Ferumbras acquired access to the shrouded library of Zathroth. They disagree, however, in the details on how exactly the vile Magician managed to do this. While some claim he was the favoured of Zathroth, others argue that he breached the library's defenses and somehow stole a part of the knowledge. Even in this the specifics are debated. An intriguing variant claims, Ferumbras once was the head librarian of the shrouded hoard. Once a kind and caring man, he became more and more obsessed with the knowledge in his care and the insights he gained turned him cynical and jaded. At some point his ambitions and power became too dangerous and he was expelled from the library. The most outlandish tales even make him a physical manifestation of forbidden knowledge. The story goes that Zathroth, who obsessively accumulated knowledge, did not care about it's containment. The knowledge was powerful though that mere books could not keep it and it seeped into the library, absorbed more and more forbidden knowledge until it became sentient and created itself a physical vessel that fled the library, later becoming known as Ferumbras. Based on the the few sources available, sages of that topic suggest that Ferumbras was the descendant of a member of the brotherhood of bones that fled and got into hiding after their forces suffered a major defeat. Ferumbras was supposedly raised in secrecy and taught in the ways and secrets of the brotherhood. Since this would not explain his immense power in one way or the other, Zathroth's library seems an all too easy and convenient explanation for his stellar rise to power. Others attribute this to his bloodline, which included the likes of Goshnar and dates back to the first magician kings of Ankrahmun who unified their people against the lizard threat."

It was then, when the mysterious Lord of Dreams revealed himself. His anger shook the foundation of the dreamland. Dreamers all over the world awakened screaming in fear and pain. When the void came to a rest and the first dreamwalkers returned to the dreamlands, the fortresses were gone - all of them and with them all the ancients who manned them. The Shaig'laar lost their best men in these days and never recovered from the loss. So weak, they became an easy prey for the other ancients and so the period of the first dream masters had come to an end.\nFrom this time on, all dreamwalkers manipulate the dreamland as little as possible, only as much as it is needed to fit their needs. Also they never use their power to endanger others in their dreams. Dreams are meant to be an instrument of self-finding and prophecy, not a weapon."

Nothing can warm up the cold hearts of evil beings, nothing can fill the loneliness. A life so centred on itself cannot be shared with others. If you do not share your life, you deny it. Life is sharing. No one can cope with life alone. You have to share your life to give birth. You have to share to feel your life. Evil beings do not feel life, so they destroy it. Evil cannot understand life, and things that cannot be understood are feared."

Try to 'fly' just on your thoughts, try to change the world around you by sheer imagination. Take some time to test reality.\nAt some point of that training you will use this routine in your sleep as well. Then it is essential to come to the conclusion that you are asleep! If you have accomplished that, you will have a hard time to balance between dreaming and awakening. At first you will often slip back in the dream state but that will change quickly.

So she asked her friend, a big wolf, to help her. The wolf put on boots and a red cape and ate some chalk to smooth his voice. Impersonating little Coalblack, he lured the elves into the darkest woods. But the elves dropped their clothes in the woods to be able to trace back the way they had taken. In the middle of the forest the elves found a magic mirror. They asked the mirror: 'Mirror, mirror in the forest, tell us whom you most adorest' And the mirror spoke 'You naked elves are pathetic!' The elves turned around and were deeply offended. 'What a bunch of incredible bums!' the mirror said. The stupid elves misunderstood the mirror and felt so flattered and cajoled that they built a gingerbread house around it and lived there happily ever after."

One day later I could spot a female wolf who had adopted the lost puppy. I recognised it by its unusual fur pattern. I didn't chase it because I was short of supplies and thus on my way to Edron. I would have missed my ship. The second whelp died shortly after. Given its weakly condition I assume the orcs wouldn't have paid for it anyway. I skinned it and sold the fur in Venore to a trader who was interested in fabrics and pelts. I can't remember her name but she was quite a poppet. Now I'm on my way to Ulderek's Rock and hopefully will make a mint of money by selling the third puppy to the orcs."

        "text": "The Ghostsilver Lantern - Scientific Research into Arcane Artefacts\nSome months ago I found a clue leading to an ancient artefact in one of the oldest tomes in this library: the Ghostsilver Lantern. Many centuries ago some of these magical artefacts were created by a powerful mage. They are made from magically treated silver and glass coated with ghostly ectoplasm. Nowadays unknown runes are engraved into the silver braces of the lantern. Thus the artefact is able to reveal hidden doors when lit. It even uncovers entrances that would otherwise be completely invisible to the naked eye. As the mage sadly didn't (or couldn't) pass his knowledge on to posterity, we can't create Ghostsilver Lanterns without further ado today. Yet I'm convinced that at least one of these lanterns still exists in the old masonry my circle has chosen for its current homestead. In the course of my explorations ofl the rooms and hallways, I discovered a separate chamber, only reachable by a stairway on the lowest floor. High in a corner there was a thick spider web and something was glittering in the sticky strands. I could catch a glimpse of a silvery and blue object that could very well have been one of the said lanterns. I couldn't reach it (not that I was afraid of the big spider guarding the web) so I had to leave empty-handed. Later on I could not return because this time the lowest floor was flooded with the creepy shapers that suddenly showed up here. I hope we'll drive them back soon so that I'll have a chance to obtain the precious artefact. With a treasure like this I could probably gain the favour of the Circle Master Uquora herself. (And I hope that before we defeat them the shapers will have made short work of the huge spider that was between me and the lantern. \u2026 Of course it was the lack of a ladder that hindered me from taking it, as I already noted.)\nZegrath, Novice of the Circle of the Black Sphinx"

In the course of time, we acquired certain insights in the ways of our masters, the Yalahari. Many years ago, things used to be very different in this city. Once it was a marvel to behold, but then it started to decay slowly and steadily. This process of deterioration begun in the far past, long before our ancestors came[ here. At the time they were brought here by the Yalahari as helpers and workers, the city already showed signs of decline. Despite their claim of having great power, the Yalahari could do little to stop the catastrophes that should occur. Neither did they do anything to restore the damaged parts of the city. Still, it took many centuries until the city had reached the pitiful state that you can witness today.\nSome decades ago, a group of Augur suspected that we all were lied to by our masters. They started to look for clues that proved their assumptions, and secretly gathered parts of the puzzle one by one. For all we know, there had been indeed a powerful race called the Yalahari that built this city to distance itself from the wars of some capricious gods. So far the tales that our masters had told us, have been true. These Yalahari were served by a group of Augur such as us. They were their helpers and workers, and the Yalahari shared some of their luxuries and achievements with them. The Yalahari concentrated on research and art, and left the more manual work to their servants, who often only knew what they had to do without understanding their tasks. At one far-away point in history, the Yalahari seemingly vanished. Certain clues that our ancestors gathered, hint that they locked themselves in the city's centre and cut off all contact to their helpers. When the Augur sometime later dared to enter the inner city, the Yalahari were all gone - vanished without a trace. After getting over the initial shock, the Augur assumed the role of the Yalahari themselves. For a while they tried to get familiar with some of the secrets of their lost masters, but they were only able to understand the most basic concepts of the Yalahari's knowledge. They stuck to their usual tasks to keep the city running. Still, they were too few to keep the enormous city, of which they understood so little, in shape.\nSo they decided to recruit Augur on their own. This way most of our forefathers came to Yalahar. In the meanwhile, the former Augur retreated into the inner city."

At some point, the city had reached a much larger population than under the rule of the true Yalahari, and it became difficult to provide food and shelter for everyone. Time and overuse took it's toll on the city. Over the years, more and more parts of the city were lost due to ignorance, lack of resources, or catastrophes. The new Yalahari were unable to restore broken machines and devices, and their efforts to retake certain parts of the city with the help of the Augur caused only more disaster. So the new Yalahari decided to stay in the city's centre, letting the Augur care for the rest of the city as well as they could. Still, their image as Yalahari allowed them to claim supremacy and to rule over the whole city. This all did not matter too much to our ancestors. The new Yalahari were neither cruel nor overly abusive, and they still wielded the powerful weapons and armors of the true Yalahari. So they stuck to the status quo and continued to work for the Yalahari despite everything they had found out. This worked quite well although the city was still declining and great parts of it had been lost to chaos and anarchy.\nLately, though, things started to change. It is not a dramatic change but it can be recognised gradually at many places. Some of the known routines in the orders of the Yalahari have altered. There are more and more orders who have a dubious purpose. The most frightening thing is that some orders obviously hint at a person with Yalahari knowledge that had been considered as lost for centuries. The overwhelming majority of the new Yalahari still clings to their ignorant and self-centred ways, but perhaps one of them or a small group has discovered some hidden secrets of their vanished masters. It is also possible that something completely different is happening, we simply don't know. But these new orders that seem to aim at restoring order in the city have some bitter taste. They are somewhat oppressive and destructive, not in an obvious way, though. Taken together, they paint a dark picture of Yalahar's future. A future of oppression, betrayal, and a much stricter rule by the Yalahari."

However, in the long run, order will be completely re-established and Yalahar will once again be the magnificent city it used to be.\nOnly with drastic decisions and changes, this great goal can be achieved. We will have to get through hard times and prepare for them as good as we can. Most importantly, a good city needs a solid base. For this reason we have to start at the bottom to clean things up. We have to be precise and consequent in our decisions and actions. This way we will be able to create a solid base for the city.\nTo some extent, we have to work like a gardener. The rotten parts have to be cut off, and the healthy parts have to be cherished. The city has to be retaken. Then order can be restored and the actual rebuilding can begin. In the end, the city will once again be a centre of prosperity and a shining light in a dark world."

All of our decisions serve a greater good, of course. Even if this is not always obvious, in the end things will work out and provide us all with a better life and a bright future.\nBased on the ruins of our former glory, it is hard to imagine how magnificent this future will be, but we, the Yalahari, still carry the vision of what we want to accomplish in our hearts. To bring this vision to life is our greatest goal which we all work towards.\nThere are elements that see their power and influence waning in these days of change. They are afraid of the things to come, and in their ignorance they cling to the rotting reality they know all too well. They created their own little niches of power and influence and feel guilty for neglecting their duties, and with that also for the decay of the city. They are surely already approaching unsuspecting outsiders to poison their minds with selfish lies. For generations the Augur, once the pride of our people, have done things the same way they had known for generations, and everyone can see where it has taken Yalahar."

First of all I'd like to give you a small historical review of tunnelling. .....<you skip the first 1000 pages containing dwarfen tunnelling history>.\nRepairing collapsed tunnels:\nEquipment: Pick, tree or bricklayers kit\nBefore picking away the rubble you need to place a buttress otherwise the tunnel will collapse over and over again. If you don't have a matching tree at hand you could still build a brickwall to stabilize the tunnel. Good luck!\nRepairing gaps:\nEquipment: Wood, wooden ties,  hammer, nails, metal fitting\nFor each missing part (on the basis of a standard rail) I recommend to use three pieces of wood. Lock them in position by at least 6 nails. For the rail itself use a saw on a piece of wood to build your wooden ties. Then place two metal fittings on them and you can make your first ride on your new rail. Congratulations!\nBuilding a rail on lava:\nI advice not to try that until you have at least 20 years experience in rail construction......<Well, seems like you don't match the premises.>\nAdventuring old tunnels:\nBe aware that our kind mastered the art of tunnelling. It may take you a whole life to understand the techniques that are used and it takes generations to know all the tunnels of a mine and all their exits. You even may find an exit that you never expected to.\nTo sum up\nIf you are no dwarf don't even try to think that you have a chance of mastering the art of tunnelling. If you are a dwarf I wish you good luck and don't abandon faith. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.\nYours\nGromward Hammerfist"

        "text": "II. 28th\nToday my brothers and I are leaving from Carlin to find a new place for us and our families. None of the great Tibian cities have made us feel at home yet. There must be something else, and we will find it.\nIII. 5th\nWe've been at sea for a few days now. Time seems endless, and so does the ocean. We have supplies for 3 more weeks. Should we not find land within the next week we will cancel our expedition to make sure we get back home safely.\nIII. 8th\nStill nothing... but the screams of seagulls and the sound of the waves... we are still hoping.\nIII. 10th\nWe've spotted land! It's still a day away, but it seems to be a really large island. Not only that,  we can also make out tall towers in the distance. Strangely though, this city - or whatever it is - can't be found on our map, despite its obvious size.\nIII. 11th\nWe've arrived at the harbour of Yalahar, as the inhabitants call it. Obviously large parts of the city are destroyed and closed for the public. We will stay in a tavern tonight - finally, a bed again! - and then try to find a place to live in.\nIII. 14th\nFinding a house seems to be harder than expected. The inner city of Yalahar which seems safe and rather wealthy has almost no place left, especially not for outsiders as us. Maybe we can live in one of the outer quarters, close to the city walls at least.\nIII. 18th\nLersatio found an unoccupied house not too far away from the centre. It is close to an alchemical lab. Maybe we can even find some work there. Things are looking great!\nIII. 20th\nWe've settled down and started the repair work on the house. This may take a while, but we are sending note to our families to come after us. Arthei's wife Kala insisted to come with us right from the start, so they are already together, but I am starting to miss my girl immensely. Oh sweet Melava, I hope you are well.\nIII. 21th\nThis place is not as good as it seemed. The closeness to the alchemical laboratories proves to be a constant menace and now I understand why they didn't want it in the centre. Frequent explosions are startling us during the whole day, and even at nighttime there is a lot of noise from the facilities. Due to these circumstances we will probably try to find another place, luckily we haven't put too much work into the house, yet. Also, our families won't come, yet.\nIII. 30th\nOh god... something horrible happened and I've not been able to write for a while... a week ago there was a HUGE explosion in the night... fire spread upon almost all houses nearby... we barely escaped the flames... my hands are burnt, because I pulled my brother out of the burning house and we all are still coughing grey substance... Boreth and Lersation got out with some scratches and burns, but otherwise we three are fine. It's just Arthei... he got burnt really badly... I barely recognise his face... Kala is sitting at his bed 24 hours a day with red swollen eyes and praying for his life. When she falls asleep in exhaustion we are keeping watch.\n<from here on, all of the pages have been torn out, only the last page remains:>\nTHE FIRST DAY OF ETERNITY\nI CAN SEE NOW. FOOLS. ALL OF YOU. HAHAHAHAHA."

At first we were all so happy about the miracle of Arthei's recovery that we didn't care about anything else, but now, some... side effects have appeared. Arthei has never looked as pale as now and he hardly speaks a single word. At least he still knows that we are his brothers, but he doesn't seem to recognise Kala, his wife. This is incredibly hard for her because she was really doing anything in her might to help him get better. And now that he is well again, he is very distant. He calls her 'that woman' and doesn't let her into his room. God, this is so bad. We are hoping that this is only a mood swing or some sort of amnesia that will pass over time...\nIV. 12th\nKala is gone!! Oh, what horrible times are those. In her sadness, and confronted with Arthei's constant rejection, she must have left the house last night. She left almost all of her belongings. We are so worried about her... and hope so badly that she didn't decide to throw her life away as desperate as she has been. Arthei didn't even notice... and when we told him, he just shrugged his shoulders. She doesn't deserve this... she is such a sweet and caring woman. We have been looking all over the city for her - in the accessible parts that is - but couldn't find her. I will look for her later again.\nIV. 13th\nKala remains missing... and Arthei seems to sneak out at night too, although he is always back in the mornings. I only noticed because I was getting up from my bed to fetch a mug of water, when I saw him closing the front door. What is he doing outside at this time? And, come to think about it, he has never left the house or even his room during daytime ever since he recovered. What has happened to him?"

And they are starting to talk... what makes matters worse is that some murders have occurred since Arthei's recovery. I don't know any details or what exactly was the cause for their death, but I can't stop thinking that Arthei might have something to do with it. His nightly excursions... the state he is in... and it seems that I'm not the only one who thinks that way. As I said... people are starting to talk...\nIV. 22th\nI don't know how long we can stay here. People whisper with each other and stare hatefully at Lersatio, Boreth and me when we cross the street.

I wanted to jump to my feet and scream, but I was unable to move. All I could do was dig my nails into my own flesh. Then suddenly, the being looked directly into my eyes. I remember thinking 'how strange', because the creature had no face and thus no eyes, yet I knew that it was looking at me. Then I couldn't bear the cold of its look anymore and passed out. I don't know what happened afterwards. All that matters now is that Arthei has recovered. And with recovered I mean that there is not a SCRATCH on him anymore.

But they did not leave the humans without guidance. There was Daraman, the gods' chosen prophet, who carefully prepared them for the spiritual and ethical challenges that awaited them in a world full of treachery and evil. And there was Banor, the very first human, a champion of superhuman might and life span, who taught his people how to fight on the battlefield. On his advice the pharaoh of Ankrahmun built a strong army, and it was Banor who designed the plans for Ankrahmun's famous fortifications. And soon enough the new human armies proved themselves in fierce battles against their undead and orcish enemies. Their kind paid heavy prices in these costly battles, but they learnt to accept sacrifices, and it soon become apparent that the human race was here to stay. Eventually only the fearsome djinns posed a real threat to the human race. They defeated the humans in several important battles using their fearsome magic and their skill with the scimitar. However, just when the situation appeared to be most dire Daraman, the revered human prophet, entered the scene and helped to neutralise the djinn threat in a way nobody had foreseen."

It has been insinuated that he acted purposefully to sow the seeds of disunity among the djinn race, but considering his personal integrity this seems unlikely. Whatever his motives, though, Daraman's teachings caused a bitter controversy among the djinns, and eventually a fierce civil war broke out. This did a lot to ease the situation for the humans, but Banor was clear-sighted enough to know that his race would sooner or later get involved into the conflict. It was not hard to work out for him which side to support. Under the influence of Daraman's teachings Gabel, his former enemy, openly propagated peaceful coexistence between humans and djinns. Banor accepted this offer in the name of all humans and formed an alliance with the Marid. It was only logical then that the Alliance fought side by side in the battle of Ankrahmun against the Efreet who had secretly allied with the Drefian necromancers. The victory of the Alliance was overwhelming, but it came with a heavy price. A cataclysmic firestorm unleashed by the Efreet set the whole Kha'labal ablaze, forever turning what used to be a paradise into a barren wasteland. Countless human lives were lost in the magic inferno, and the survivors found that their homes had been destroyed. Faced with a choice of slowly starving to death or leaving their native land forever, a large group of survivors followed Banor on his quest for a new home. Their exodus triggered a chain of events that eventually resulted in the cataclysmic wars of the unliving, but it was also the fateful moment when the humans' slow, but steady conquest of the whole of Tibia started. But that is a different story."

Working with superhuman resolve and ruthlessly exterminating all real or imaginary competition, Gha'Zuul managed to rise to the top of the Drefian hierarchy within a few decades, and when a bizarre accident happened to the president of the High Council, Gha'Zuul took his place. He was the first necromancer to take this position while still being alive. However, being the foremost necromancer was still not enough to satisfy Gha'Zuul\u2019s thirst for power. He had great plans for Drefia. Under his rule the necromancer city would expand and conquer, taking over control of the north and perhaps of the whole of Darama! It was his idea to propose an alliance to the Efreet, and when the decisive battle drew near he personally raised the necromancers' troops to march against the Marid.\nThe rest is well-known. Drefia's troops suffered a decisive defeat in the battle of Ankrahmun. Those undead who were not destroyed during the futile siege of Ankrahmun were pulverised in the searing heat his own allies had summoned. Gha'Zuul realised soon enough that his career in Drefia was rapidly drawing to an end, for if the Marid did not kill him his fellow necromancers surely would. And so he disappeared...\nToday, there are nothing but rumours as to what happened to Gha'Zuul after the failed campaign. However, many believe that Gha'Zuul is still out there, waiting for an opportunity to take revenge just like he used to do when he was still a little nomad boy."

She grew up in the pharaoh's palace, living a seemingly careless life amidst the proverbial luxury and splendour of the Ankrahmunian court, and when her father arranged for her to marry a well-proven northern nobleman her happiness seemed complete. But things were not quite the way they seemed. Theripat, who was a headstrong and idealistic girl, had always despised life at the court, and with the help of her nurse she had made many forays into the city, concealing her true identity. On one of these excursions she had fallen in love with a handsome officer from the pharaoh's guard. The young man requited the love of what he thought was a simple woman, and eventually the two lovers had even married. When the pharaoh finally decided it was time for his daughter to marry she was already 6 months pregnant, and she knew that soon the truth could no longer be hidden. Frightened and confused, Theripat went through the wedding preparations without saying a word, but when the day had finally come she fled the court. The whole extent of the scandal soon became obvious."

Hurt and angered by the constant humiliations, Gha'Zuul developed a bitter, unforgiving personality.

One of the necromancers who was part of the raiding party sensed the evil of this deed, and since he was impressed by the young boy's obvious ruthlessness he ordered his undead troops to kidnap him.

Theripat herself had escaped into the desert with her new-born child, but her unforgiving father sent half his army after her.

Clinging her baby to her breast, the desperate mother fell into a piercing, bloodcurling wail that quickly expanded into an unearthly sound to which nature itself seemed to respond. All of a sudden a sandstorm erupted, fiercer and stronger than anybody could remember, and within minutes destruction rained down upon the pharaoh's terrified troops. When the storm cleared the soldiers were severely shaken, and many of the pharaoh's best chariots lay shattered in the sand. Theripat and her child, however, were gone forever, and nobody has seen them ever since. But each time the storm rages over the Kha'labal the superstitious people fall into a silent prayer to appease the wailing bride's fury."

The shadows which in those days held the rest of the world in their cold grip became aware of the humans and of their riches, and soon enough they began to plot the young race's destruction. Ferocious orcs built fleets and started raiding the south-western coastline, while the north was threatened by eerie undead who began to spread their insidious poison among the terrified humans. Worse, the corruption slowly found its way into many of the humans's hearts, and strife and armed conflict erupted within the community. Some humans even fell for the morbid attraction of undeath. They formed an evil cult of necromancers and went to the north to found a city of their own. This city was called Drefia, and it soon became a source of the foulest corruption.\nThe humans, who were not used to such challenges, were full of sadness and despair, and many cursed the gods who apparently watched their plight in apathy. Little did they understand that all this was part of the gods' plan. It would take the humans a long time to understand that the very purpose of their race was to fight evil, and that their fate was not eternal bliss but endless struggle."

What's more, the hyena king is said to be truly immortal, for it has been sighted time and again by numerous travellers and merchants. Many a caravan is said to have fallen prey to this ferocious beast, and it is widely believed to have amassed untold treasures over the centuries. The legend goes that this beast was once a common hyena that was born in the time when the djinn war was at its peak. Somehow it had managed to escape the cataclysmic firestorm unleashed by the Efreet during the battle of Ankrahmun, and when the slaughter had finally ended it fed from the bodies of the fallen djinns, consuming large amounts of magical energy in the process. Perhaps these magical energies were responsible for the fateful mutation that turned a common hyena into this frightful beast."

Many djinn refused to betray Gabel, but the majority of the strongest djinn warriors rallied to his cause, and since Malor had been plotting his insurrection for a long time the rebels were well-prepared. When Malor finally gave the signal his minions attacked the palace in full force, planning to kill Gabel swiftly. Their attack was deadly effective, and the palace guards were quickly overwhelmed. However, Gabel, who had received warning about the conspiracy was saved in time by his trusted aide and friend Fa'hradin. He managed to flee in the darkness, and that very night he started to gather his troops in order to take revenge on the usurper. Malor, on the other hand, had to acknowledge that his plan to get rid of Gabel quickly had failed. And he ordered his followers to prepare for a long-term military engagement. Neither he nor Gabel realised then that this was the starting point for a war that would last for eons."

Both Malor and Gabel tried to win over as many followers as they could, and the need to take a choice war weighed heavily on many a djinn's conscience. Still, few of them managed to remain neutral in this terrible war, and so a deep rift opened within the djnn race. Families were torn apart as children turned against their parents and brother fought brother. Worst of all, it soon turned out that both sides were roughly equal in strength, so that even though a number of vicious battles ensued it become more and more apparent that victory could not be won easily in this war. In fact, it appeared more and more likely that even if one of the sides could win it, it would so be crippled by the endeavour that the very existence of the djinn race would be threatened. Still the war raged on relentlessly. And the mutual hatred between the two fractions, who began to call themselves by the distinct names of Marid and Efreet, increased with every battle that was fought."

Gabel, who was prepared to do anything to stop the fratricidal war, accepted the challenge. The enemies agreed to meet in the fertile plains of Kha'labal. There they stood, face to face, the old king and the usurper, and so did their armies, because neither of two was gullible or foolish enough to come on his own. It was the greatest gathering of djinns in recorded history.\nEventually Gabel stepped forward to meet his opponent. This was the moment Malor, who had never intended to fight honourably, had been waiting for. All of a sudden the earth opened in a thousand places, and hordes of vicious undead attacked Gabel and his army. For Malor had secretly formed an alliance with the dreaded necromancers of Drefia and it was them who controlled the undead hordes that fought for him. Faced with an overwhelming enemy, Gabel and his army turned to flee."

And how much greater was his surprise to find that the Marid fled to the city of Ankrahmun where they appeared were expected! It was then that he realised that Gabel had suspected a ruse all along, and that he had prepared a counterstrategy. Malor immediately ordered his troops to abandon pursuit, but it was too late. The undead marched against Ankrahmun with all the determination of a mindless killing machine, and the Efreet, blinded by rage, did not lag behind, only to be met by ceaseless barrages of arrows and catapult stones. A cataclysmic battle ensued.\nWave after wave of undead and Efreet stormed against Ankrahmun, and wave after wave broke at the huge fortifications of the ancient city. Both the Marid and the humans were well-prepared for this battle, and even though Malor's army wreaked havoc they never yielded."

He summoned the most powerful Efreet wizards and ordered them to unleash a huge column of magic fire onto Ankrahmun in order to render the city and all those in it to cinders. The Efreet wizards' followed his orders and soon a wall of devastating fire rose up to the sky. However, when they tried to move it onto Ankrahmun they soon realised that it did not move into the desired direction. The Marid had soon seen through Baa'leals plan, and Fa'hradin and his fellow Marid mages used their own magic to turn the devastating flames against their creators. A fierce battle of wills ensued between the mages from both sides, and the whole battle came to a halt when the two armies watched in horrified fascination as the terrible pile of flames wandered seemingly undecided to and fro. But then, all of a sudden, the pile made a sudden leap to the north, and within seconds those who had summoned it from the sky were reduced to smouldering ashes. That was the turning point of the great battle."

However, for the winners there was little left to feel triumphant about. The losses had been great on both sides, and the Kha'labal, that beautiful garden given to the humans by the gods, had been turned into a barren, hostile desert. Also, the destruction cause the fire had allowed many Efreet to escape, so it seemed unlikely that the war would end now. However, for the time being Malor and his troops were much too weak to pose a serious military threat, so Gabel decided to abandon pursue. Instead he ordered that his army should move northwards towards Drefia. It seemed time to settle old scores."

So the necromancers prepared for the inevitable with the defiant cynicism of those who have been familiar with death all their lives, performing evil rituals and indulging in morbid orgies.\nFinally, the end came swifter than they expected. Unwilling to take any risks in the unpredictable halls and passageways of Drefia's dungeons, the Marid performed a fearsome ritual. The tortured earth underneath Drefia started moving like a giant whirlpool, and slowly the unholy city was pulled inside the maelstrom. Within half an hour it was gone completely, and all but the highest buildings were completely covered by sand and by rubble. None of its inhabitants have ever been seen again, but rumour has it that deep beneath the surface the unholy city is still intact, brooding like a vengeful animal in its prison."

In his desperation, Gabel turned to his trusted friend Fa'Hradin for advice. The old djinn suggested using a trick to eliminate Malor. Without their leader, he reasoned, the Efreet would end the rebellion. Gabel, who wanted to avoid further bloodshed, agreed. And so it came to pass that the magic lamp was created and, by means that are unknown to this very day, secretly placed in Malor's private chamber. The mighty Efreet never had a chance. When he went to sleep in what he thought was his private lamp he was trapped inside the lamp, which was soon enough smuggled out of Mal'Ouquah, the Efreets' fortress, and brought back to the Marid. Fa'hradin's trick had worked - Malor was Gabel's prisoner."

One fateful day the lamp was found and brought to the orc king. It did not take the king's shamans long to work out that a mighty spirit was caught in the lamp, and soon enough the reckless king released the mighty djinn that had lain dormant for so many centuries. Little is known about what happened next, but even though to this day the orcs claim their king is still alive there are no credible witnesses who confirm that they have seen the orc king ever since.

A lot of stories were told, but do these stories really belong to each other? Could these people really exist? I doubt it! Once a traveller came to me, who wanted to convince me that Netlios stories are real. I asked him to tell me the names (in alphabetical order), the ages, the reasons why they stopped their journeys and the length of their adventures.\nAt the beginning, I wanted him to give me the first name, his reasons and all this.\nHe wispered:\n\"Anaso, 38, troll attacked, 66 days\".\nI asked him to tell me about the next person:\n\"Elaeus, 40, steped into fire, 100 days\".\nI also asked him about the last three persons, and he gave me his answers.\nAt the beginning, his words seemed plausible to me. But after thinking about it and reading parts of Netlios' stories again, I noticed, that this can't be true.\nA lot of people came to me, bringing \"their\" versions of (wrong) solutions to my questions. There was never someone, who was able to give me a correct answer...\nDoes an answer exist?

Some of these stones looked very much like today's seeds; that isn't just per chance.\nObviously, some of the round, small, brown stones,which were somehow placed some fingerlength deep in the earth, started\ngrowing in the directions of the sun - in the opposite direction of hell. That is how plants and trees were created\n- big trees came out of big stones, small plants out of small stones.\n\nNow one may ask oneself (or me): How did animals come into the world?\nI thought really long about this question, and I obviously found the correct answer.\n\nOnce there were plants existing they started \"mixing\" with stones:\nPlants are living objects (just like\nanimals are), but they can't move very fast (animals move fast). Stones on the other hand do not live, but they can\nmove very fast (think about stones falling down a mountain).\n\nThat's how animals and monsters started to exist."

Well, there are not very many sources of drinks: First, you can take some potions of water with you. Second, you can \"find\" something on your way. For example, you might cross a river or perhaps it might rain one day or the other. And maybe you can even find drinks on your way, but be careful! You never know what is inside the potion you find. Let me again give you an example to illustrate this:\nOne of our five men travelling through Tibia (his name was longer than the name of the adventurer, who was attacked by a troll and therefore had to stop his exploration) one day found a filled potion on his way. He was very thursty, and so he drank the liquid inside. He didn't know (how should he?) that it was poisoned. After some moments he noticed, that he felt worse and worse. At this moment, he had to stop and return to his house. By the way, the name of this man (the poisoned one) was shorter than the name of the man, whose journey was over after 83 days."

One journey ended after 83 days, one after 117 and finally one after 134 days. Anaso, one of the explorers, was a very brave sword-fighter. His brother Elaeus, who started an expedition just like his brother, never wanted to use a sword - instead he was an excellent magician. Hestus, another explorer whom i will tell about, always wore green trousers, so no-one saw how dirty it was and he never had to wash it."

Thus, five would be called \"tutututumog\". It doesn't seem to me as if they would have highly developed mathematics, but the way to count seems sufficient for them. I wonder, how they were able to build this town...?\nMaybe an answer is, that they do not speak about numbers, but have short signs for writing them down.\nIt was surprising for me to find out they have a word for \"zero\", namely \"mog\".

Put your team and the opposite team in a large field and build a high wall around them.\n(The reason for this is that, although the game is a major spectator sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what's going on leads them to imagine that it's just a lot more exciting than it really is. A crowed that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life-affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history.\n4. Throw lots of assorted equipment over the wall for the players. Anything will do -- cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis rackets, skis, anything you can get a good swing with.\n5. The players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand.\nWhenever a player scores a 'hit' on another player he should immediately run away and apologize from a save distance. Apologies should be concise, sincere, and, for maximum clarity and points, delivered through a megaphone.\n6. The winning team should be the first team that wins."

A rope consists of many rat-tails tied together. Such a thing should not be missing in an adventurer's backpack!\nIt is not known, how it works in some cases - for example, no one found out until now, why one has to put a rope on the floor in order to climb UP a hole.

Beer is an invention of the demon!\nThere is another very mysterious fluid here in Tibia. People tend to call it \"oil\". I really don't know what to do with it. It smells strange; if you know how to put it on fire, it burns quite fine (it's not easy, but once it burns it is very hot!).\nAvoid steping on a pool of oil - it's very slippery. That leads me to an idea: My watch doesn't work anymore since yesterday - maybe I should try to throw it in a glass filled with oil? If I succeed, I will write another book on this topic.\nThe last known brown fluid is \"mud\". It is a very familiar fluid; it doesn't smell, but it is dirty.

Indeed, it is a most natural phenomenon, and we have to discern thusly between the natural undead, appearing out of a natural course, e.g., out of some supreme will inherent to the late inhabitant of our world of the living; and between the scientific method of inducing undeath , and creating undead through an outside, e.g. OUR, will. Of the natural undead, little use can be made, for they obey their own strong will and will not be bended or made to pursue more noble fashions after our own will; so the most noble art of a necromancer lies in besting the natural course, indeed, in perfectioning it, and in bringing back life in death, and creating able-bodied subjects to carry out the most noble purposes of our order."

The natural undead make up for most of the undead types; and we have but to wonder at the mean understanding of the outsiders to our art not seeing this. I will begin my dissertation with categorizing the undead, beginning with the natural undead in this first chapter, followed by a categorization of the technical undead in the second chapter. The means of resurrecting the undead will be studied and an ample introduction be given by my honoured colleague, professor rer. mort. Arrazul Alhazri in his book \"An Initiation to Practical Necromancy\".\nThus, to return to our study: the nature of the undead. The natural undead,  like ghosts and vampires, are indeed abundant on this world. Many have been spotted in the different locations in Tibia, and all seem to pursue a singular goal, which they have been denied in life and which they therefore seek to achieve in undeath.  As many of the lesser mortals that inhabit the lands of Tibia are not able to reach their goals in life, one must not wonder at the abundancy of the natural undead.\nTo the natural undead, we count the following specimen with their sub-classifications:\n1.\tGhosts:\na)\tspectres\nb)\tspirits\nc)\tphantasms\nd)\t apparitions\n2.\tbanshees\n3.\treapers\n4.\tvampires\na)\tvampire bats\nb)\tvampire brides\nc)\tvampire lords\n5.\t Special consideration must be given to the hybrid classes:\na)\t lesser forms of demon spirits\nb)\tGhouls\nc)\tmummies"

Death is but the portal, not the end; it is but an artificial hindrance to ward off the lesser spirits from the realm of the mighty; and the gods put it up to prevent us Chosen from ascension to their own powers, and threaten their dominion. These shackles to our existence are unnatural; but it is natural to rebel and to seek power, yes, to gain power, to exert power! Brothers, we must overcome this hindrance set up by the jealous gods and claim our rightful place! We are the masters of the living and undead, the true lords of the created, and nothing shall stop us from achieving what we seek."

If you stop the chant for longer than a breath, horrible shadows will stalk you and whisper foul dreams in your ears while you wake, the undead lord will raise his putrid hand to squash you, and the demons shall feast on your intestines while you still live to see it. now sing the following:\nParri dusk tvan vi\nant'haxi gar m'rassti\nPrarush forassim\nDroruk urgithan.\nThe Chant is hopefully completed by now.

Since then he has kept to himself, and when I approach, he stares at me as if he did not recognise me. ...\nHe's getting stranger all the time. I think it's these... gems he found. He keeps cooing over them like a hen. He hisses and snarls! I believe I must get used to the thought that the last thing my brother cared about in this world was a heap of glowing pebbles. Whoever finds this I hope has the good sense to grab a shovel and dig free of this place."

        "text": "The Iks\nA Disquisition (abridged) by the venerable Sir Galthen\nThe tale of Iksupan, the City of Gold, is of a vast kingdom of old. Once prospering and shining in the radiance of its own glory it did not sink to perish like many a lost world: it was taken. To grasp the full magnitude of this most peculiar end, one has to understand the lore and culture of a very ancient part of this world. Due to a lingering fear of the wrath of Kopakhn, god of the balance of life, the people of the Tribe of Iks have been building vast underground cities and palaces. Kopakhn was thought to be the bringer of a cleansing storm, sweeping over the face of the known world. Destroying man, animal and growth alike. So the Iks saw their only salvation in taking to the innards of this earth while forestalling the cleansing by conquering as much of their known world as possible. To appease him, the Iks amassed a wealth of treasure, conquered all the lands of their ancestors and built intricate structures of stone and gold deep underground. Their sincere worship of Kopakhn was also a gesture of gratitude towards his might and divine judgement. Feeling safe in their untiring contributions towards the great goal of the propitiation of their powerful god, their civilisation thrived. The more kingdoms they seized, the more wealth they hoarded, the further they would reach.\nWhen conquerors came from distant parts of the world, the Iks prevailed. Lured by the gold and wealth of their sanctuaries build in the name and spirit of their gods, many foreign knights and mercenaries would invade their sacred grounds. Driven by the lust for riches and glory, the invaders would come ever further and soon roam the lands of the Iks in great numbers. Fending off the foreign aggressor month after month, year after year, the Iks grew angrier and more relentless. They blamed their gods and even Kopakhn became a subject of their ire. The people lost faith in their deities and blamed their priests and sages. In fear of losing control, the highest caste of the Iks tried to uphold order by demanding sacrifices to Kopakhn as well as Tikatl, god of lightning, rage and war. And sacrifices where made. The steps of the great sanctuary of Kopakhn ran red with blood. The worshippers of Tikatl built large outside structures with high beams made of pure gold to attract his mighty thunder and sweeping lightning. Man and animal alike where presented and delivered to the wrath of the furious priests and their angry gods. Their victims in battle would suffer dark rituals and wild ceremonies to feed their souls directly to Tikatl, presenting the hearts to the ever watching Kopakhn.\nThen came the time of the iron haze. An otherworldly mist fell on many settlements and underground sanctuaries. The day the mist arrived would mark the end of any such habitat. Inhaling this haze seemed to have a strange benumbing effect on every living creature and even the walls and the very gold and stone the Iks built their mighty empire upon. After the mist cleared, the iron silenced the few Iks still able to stand. Like leaves brought by a swift wind, sharp blades and quick knives danced through the golden chambers. Room after room emptied of life, torches choked, the fires dead like the people of the Iks lying scattered amongst unfathomable riches. Priest, guard and worker alike, all betrayed, their bones shattered and their souls hurt in disbelief, doubting their gods. Word of these occurrences travelled through the Ikian world and its remaining people fled their homes, temples and sanctuaries. During a long and burdensome time of nomadism far away from their ancestral realm, the Iks all but disappeared. They never recovered and ultimately died in exile."

Also, the birth rate dropped dramatically. Two generations later the race of the Shapers was no more - or so it seemed. Some of them had managed to flee to remote areas filled with magic. The strong fluxes of magic there allowed them to erect secret forges to harness their power without being seen by the other greedy races.\nFor the hidden Shapers these secret bases became a beacon of hope. While the rest of their civilisation perished, some elite survived in hiding. However, since their network was utterly destroyed, most of their vast knowledge was lost forever.\nEven worse, the Astral Shapers had been so accustomed to access the network that they found themselves unable to handle the knowledge of their ancestors. Access to recourses necessary to operate their complicated artefacts had been lost as well. Often lacking important skills needed for day-to-day survival, the whole race seemed doomed. Many hideouts became death traps that turned into tombs for those who had hoped to find salvation there. Only a very small number of these colonies managed to survive for a significant amount of time. The harsh environment of the hideouts took a heavy toll on the survivors and slowly moulded them into new beings who only remotely resembled the noble figures of their ancestors.\nThe Shapers have been forgotten for a long time and their accomplishments seemed to be lost. Recently, however, the great archaeologist Darama Smith uncovered some ancient tomes which led him on many adventures. On his expeditions he rediscovered two of the underground complexes which had been thought to be lost forever. Astonishingly, one of them was still populated with the degenerated descendants of the Shapers. Unfortunately, both facilities were destroyed in fights between the adventurous archaeologist and the minions of the evil mastermind Professor Maxxen. Some knowledge, however, could be salvaged and some insights into the history of the Shapers could be gained and shared."

        "text": "The Fall of the Astral Shapers by Teruvax Tristem - Part 2\nThe Astral Shapers relied more and more on their slaves' workforce as well as on their knowledge network. This situation worked well for them for a while. But then a new powerful warlord arose. The wars were often a back and forth like the tides of the sea. This was the way things were and the races had grown accustomed to it. This new warlord, however, was tired of that game. He decided to eliminate the one advantage that turned the tides of battle once and for all. Instead of fearing to lose the support of the Shapers by fighting them, he speculated on bolstering his own strength if he managed to steal the Shapers' powers somehow.\nThe Shapers were no longer prepared for war. Their slave troops, equipped with magically boosted weapons, were labourers not fighters. Moreover, they harboured no love for their masters. The more remote communication towers were the first to fall. This led to confusion and fear among the Shapers. The gaping holes in their communication were highly disturbing, leaving blind spots all over the realm. In this state of disarray, the first cities of the Shapers fell quickly.\nAs word spread about the actions of the warlord, another flaw became evident. Greedy as the Shapers had been, they had made some humble customers but never friends. When the other races heard about the warlord's success, they feared for their own power. To show the warlord their good will, they started to attack the Shapers, too. Things snowballed as even the more benevolent races decided to join in. After all they could not afford to leave all of the Shapers' knowledge and powers to their enemies.\nSoon the Shapers' cities were razed to the ground by a tidal wave of armies. In a last-ditch effort some of the Shapers used their quickly dwindling knowledge to forge themselves into living weapons. This, however, only led to more severe retaliation against the Shaper populace. Within less than a decade the cities of the Shapers lay in ruins. Their people were enslaved and deported into remote realms.\nThe enslaved Shapers lacked most of the knowledge they had once shared. In an effort to recreate the lost knowledge, several of the captor races squeezed out each bit of knowledge from their captives and compiled them into so-called Shaper records. The fragmentary knowledge they acquired was hardly of any practical use. Moreover, the different races were unwilling to share the records with each other. For this reason, a reconstruction of the Shapers' work was impossible.\nDuring this time, a vast number of Shaper records was created and even copied. However, when the astral forges fell into disrepair, the records were considered worthless. Instead of gathering and comparing the records, they were soon forgotten.\nUnable to operate the Shapers' forges, most of them were destroyed by the conquering races. They did not want to risk them falling into the wrong hands."

        "text": "The Fall of the Astral Shapers by Teruvax Tristem - Part 1\nNowadays the beings commonly known as the Astral Shapers have largely been forgotten. Back in the days, however, they were one of the most important races of the God Wars. Favoured by Uman and Zathroth alike, they were blessed with a unique kind of vision that enabled them to see magical structures and flows. Their speech was a mixture of verbal communication and magical emanations. Their true name was a mixture of barely pronounceable syllables and magical symbols. For this reason, the other races of that time referred to them as Astral Shapers or just Shapers.\nTheir keen understanding of magical structures was oddly paired with a very structured and logical way of thinking. Therefore, the Shapers were never really fond of spontaneous magic based on spells. From the beginning, they preferred to imbue objects with magical effects. While this might have been only a preference in the earlier days of their civilisation, it later became an integral part of their culture, going so far that spell magic was frowned upon as something primitive, dangerous and offensive.\nIn their earliest days the Astral Shapers were relatively insignificant. Some of them were enslaved or hired as advisors for all kind of magical matters. The creation of enormous, magical towers in their cities was their first major accomplishment. Those towers somehow connected the minds of all Shapers in a city and enabled them to access some sort of hive mind in which they stored and shared their knowledge.\nWith these shared insights the Shapers' technology made vast progress in a short amount of time. The advances that they made in terms of technology led to a rapid growth in their power and status. This allowed them to construct more towers which were increasingly technologically advanced. Eventually all of the Shaper cities were connected via a network of Shaper towers. Having access to the shared knowledge of a whole nation, the progress to advance the science of bound magic gained momentum and seemed unstoppable. Focusing on knowledge, the wars that ravaged the world became a tedious annoyance for the Shapers. Eventually they assumed a neutral position. When the other races realised that the Shapers were willing to provide their knowledge to everybody who was willing to pay the right price, they grudgingly accepted the Shapers' new status. This allowed the Astral Shapers to explore the depths of magic freely without having to deal with the bickering of the other races of their time.\nFor a while the Shapers prospered. However, their special status and the constant flattering of the other races that wanted their favours turned the Shapers vain and greedy. Seeing themselves as higher beings, they increasingly relied on slaves for the more mundane tasks. Often the Shapers were paid in slaves for their services. These unfortunate slaves served under their uncaring masters until they died."

Above all, fertile races have been targets of these abductions. Orcs lead the statistics of known abductions by UMOs, followed by mankind. This suggests that breeding purposes are the main reason for these abductions.\nOnly about one third of the abducted beings return, albeit with a lack of memory. Their relatives often report that the personality of the abducted has 'changed' in a disturbing way.\nThe UMOs are often described as floating, colourful lights accompanied by a phenomenon that resembles a paralyse spell. Even if a group encounters such an UMO, only particular individuals are abducted. Several of those who had been returned became victims of such abductions repeatedly.\nConsidering their abilities, it is obvious that the UMOs are somehow connected to the magic forces. Furthermore, the UMOs seem to be entities rather than vehicles or something like that. Some scientists believe that the UMOs have developed from pure magic to sentient beings, probably caused by some experiments by an extinct race during the God Wars. According to another valid theory, the UMOs are actually souls of an extinct race that has been banished into the astral realm by some catastrophe. Since they do not have a body of their own, they abduct beings in order to create new host bodies through breeding.\nTaking into consideration for how long the abductions have been taking place now, the UMOs must have made some progress. Their might even be agents of them among us in a human or orcish body who work hand in hand with their bodiless brethren. These agents infiltrate society to further their own cause, either by looking for appropriate breeding candidates or by discrediting or withholding records about UMO activities. They might also initiate smear campaigns to ruin the reputation of researchers who are close to uncover their dark secret.\nSince governments are a major target of infiltration, one wonders who is the driving force behind certain secret services and their activities.\nDid the Venorean trade ship in the far north really have an accident, or was it an attempt to prevent that the ship discovered a hidden UMO base?\nThe more we ask for answers, the more silence we find. Is this evidence that infiltration is real and that the minions of the UMOs are amongst us? I think, yes it is! Be aware! Always look up to the sky when it's dark!"

Indeed the first of those cults where founded by ancient races, most long forgotten, that suffered greatly in the creation wars. Most of those races only barely escaped complete extinction and none ever recovered from the blood toll of the wars. In fact some of those 'races' are rumored to have been reduced to a handful of beings or even a single entity. However some of them tried to gain converts from the younger races to bolster their ranks. The methods to keep their races and cults alive over the centuries differed and most tries were in vain. It's assumed that in our days only a handful of godslayer cults exists and perhaps another handful of single entities that follow this agenda. Be it as it may, for sure is that the name godslayer defines and summarizes their philosophies, or at least the ends of these philosophies. Their\ngoal is nothing less than the extermination of the gods (or in some cases of a specific god). The means through which this goal is to be achieved differ, if they are clear at all. Most cultists are probably content with hating the gods and\nspreading discord among their worshipers. Some might have very specific plans as the last of the Rardor, Tel'Chac Agur, who tried to take over the soulvortex in the early new ages. In most cases a godslayer cult surfaced, it was handled by human worshipers of the gods without real divine interference. It's said though, that the destruction of the isle Molinora was caused by the dark magic\nof Zathroth and his demon armies and the last of the dark race of Souleaters (also known as the Noshar) were annihilated with their dark temple and forbidden secrets they had collected in this last retreat of that cruel race."

Zathroth's teachings say that knowledge is infinite and so is his library.\nIt is said in the beginning the library was only the virtual shadow that was cast by Umans hallowed halls of enlightenment, but the shadow grew with each secret that was kept, each piece of knowledge that wasn't meant to be known. And so dark secrets gave birth to even more twisted insights.\nSince its creation the hoard feasts on secrets and knowledge. It grows and spawns new rooms and chambers, hidden passages and halls of displaced geometry. \nIn the case of the hidden library, the phrase that 'knowledge is power' becomes reality in that the power of the accumulated knowledge manifests in reality bending ways that seem to mock the very concepts of time, space and existence. \nFanatics of Zathroth claim that the library also contains at least parts of 'the true speech', the first and only true language, the syllables the gods whispered at the dawn of creation. Each word, eons long, containing the power to create or destroy, shredding its speaker out of existence.\nKnowledge hidden in lies, truth gained by insanity, enlightenment by force of will combined with greed and selfishness that leads to power: these are the hallmarks of the shrouded hoard.\nThough they enviously protect the hoard, Zathroth and his minions tempt the powerful with glimpsing visits of the hoard. If they prove ruthless and powerful enough to force their way into it. The reward is of course a poisoned one since one shed of forbidden knowledge is never enough. The taste of knowledge seeds a hunger that becomes unbearable to overcome. Everything but more dark knowledge loses its worth and the tainted view of the world becomes cynical and dull. Things once held in value don't matter anymore and the only pleasure one can experience is gaining more knowledge - and even that has to be more substantial yet obscure with every time. This spiral into mad-stricken greed leads many to compile knowledge on their own, figure out forbidden things and bind them into new tomes that one day mysteriously make their way into the hoard with their author vanished under curious circumstances."

        "text": "Zathroth's library was the major temple of the cult of Zathroth in ancient times. Though supposed to be secret, it was unavoidable that such a place became known through rumors and gossip. There the high priests of Zathroth compiled all knowledge they came into possession. Some of it was written by themselves, others were donations of worshipers and others simply bought. When the great purge came, the hidden library as it was called, was seized and destroyed by the Inquisition. The books were secured and given to the priests of Uman to be reviewed, along with any artifacts that were found. Everything that was deemed blasphemous was destroyed by them. The worldly possessions such as land, gold and jewelry fell to the crown. The library was dismantled stone by stone and its caverns filled with earth. No sign of the library remained, though desperate Zathrothi still claimed it was not the real hoard of their divine patron that was destroyed but only an insignificant mimicry of the true place. Since the Inquisition could not prove these claims to be true, all of them have to be assumed wishful thinking of desperate Zathroth worshipers and propaganda for their underground movement."

        "text": "Magnor Mournbringer was more a mystic and philosopher than a knight. It is said he was forced into knighthood by his father, albeit himself aspiring to become a sorcerer. He was more a man of the books than of the sword, more often found in the study then on a jousting field. He was permanently banished from tournaments for the usage of alchemical concoctions. Still obligated to fight in battles on behalf of his king he relied more on sorcery then on his physical prowess. He enchanted and inscribed first his armour and weapons, later even his own body. He enhanced his skill and fortitude through powerful potions and brought his enemies down with runes and spells. The other knights shunned him but the 'witch-knight', as they called him, had his uses for the king. Giving little for chivalrous staples and being very pragmatic, the witch-knight was the one that the king called upon, when a dirty deed had to be done, something sinister to be accomplished. As times were dark and dire, the call for his skill was frequent. His fame and notoriety grew. On the height of his might and favour of the king he was nigh untouchable, reigning freely in his realm. Dubious visitors from all corners of the world frequented him. Rumours grew even more then his legend. When his patron, the king surprisingly died and not his sickly child was crowned but his pious cousin was made regent of the realm, his enemies made their complaints heard loudly. Soon the inquisition investigated in the case and it came to a direct confrontation when they tried to size Magnor's vast library for examination. Blows were traded and in the end the keep of Magnor was besieged by the regents army. With no other way to escape, the witch-knight summoned winged demons to carry him into safety. But the priests, accompanying the army, banished the creatures and Magnor fell to his death. When the regency ended and the king's son became ruler, Magnors honor was reinstated to some extent in memory of the dead king that cherished him. So he was given a proper funeral."

Sometimes in his travels, while he already was a well-known and established knight, he acquired the secret of eternal youth. It is said that it was granted to him as a wish by fairies whom he had helped. Some whisper he had to sacrifice his own heart to acquire this gift. At least all sources agree that he was a changed man in his later live. While friends of old one by one retired and died, loved ones came and went, he grew more and more bitter and jaded. While he perfected his knightly arts more and more over the decades that passed, his views on knightly virtues became cynical at best. He sought out more and more perilous challenges, as they say out of a death wish. Regardless what fighter or menace he challenged, he went out victorious. He begun to let the more promising opponents live, albeit scarred and disfigured by his hand. It was assumed that this was his way to groom new challengers, to endanger his own live to at least sometimes feel some form of thrill. He antagonized the mighty and had only spite for the just and religious. Yet no challenger could match his skills. He fathered many children over the years and raised them with an iron fist, putting them through rigorous trainings and humiliation. That way he was fostering new generations of opponents that might be worthy one day to give him a challenge at last. At last it was his halve-elven daughter that would be his downfall. While she was a promising fighter he mistreated her like he always did with his children. When she dared to question his attitude once he had her mouth stitched shut. When he held a dashing young adventurer captive in his hold, she rescued him and the two fled. Vlarkorth followed them dispassionately. The hunt was just a mild thrill for him but better than nothing. So he chased them from one end of the world to another. Over the course of their adventures the fleeing pair made new friends and gathered a party of merry men and women. Sometimes Vlarkorth caught up but his prey eluded him in the end, albeit not without casualties. At some point the couple decided they could not run any longer. Alongside their allies they made a last stand and faced the heartless Vlarkorth. In a fierce battle one by one of their companions were wounded or killed. In the end only the halve-even maid and her lover stood against the barely wounded Vlarkorth. It was apparent that they both were no match for the ancient knight. As he was about to kill his daughter, the adventurer impaled himself on Vlarkorth 's weapon and weightened it down. The women, using her refined reflexes to honour his sacrifice, dispatched her ruthless father with a swift blow once and for all. Vlarkorth was buried in shame at a remote place."

Usually elves love to add a translation of their name which is often mistaken for a second name by other races.

His prodigous son Paron was destined to follow him as a competent ruler to lead the realm to further prosperity. Yet the king's younger son Olbret was as ambitious as jealous. He plotted the assassination of his sibling, in league with sinister forces. With promises of the restoration of former grandeur he allied himself with elements of the secret church of Zathroth. However, by chance or divine intervention of the gods, the inquisition discovered the plot and arrested Olbret. But by then he already managed to place a potent poison for Paron to which the latter succumed within a week, despite all efforts of healers and clergery. So a distant cousin of the brothers, Zelos, was named successor of the old king. This decision did not suit well with some of the most powerful nobles in the realm. This dispute overshadowed the last years of Ottremar, now a broken man, becoming more and more fragile with each passing week. When Zelos took the mantle of kingship, the boiling anger erupted. With reluctant nobles disputing the new king's right to rule, the once prospering realm was on the brink of open rebellion. Zelos was well aware of his shortcomings in regard of ruler ship. After being named successor he had dedicated himself to the studies of the kings that had come and gone in the past. When he became king and with civil war on the horizon, he decided that books weren't efficient and fast enough to teach him the needed skills. He decided to learn from the source itself instead. He consulted spiritists, shamans and even necromancers to summon the spirits of the kings of old to act as his advisors. This again arose the suspicion of the inquisition and even increased inner tensions. More and more desperate, Zelos turned not only to the advice of some reluctant ancestors but almost any spiritual entity that was willing to listen to his plea and to teach. Some of those spirits were more persistent and did not leave, once called into the world. So Zelos was soon hearing voices and whispers all day and even in his sleep. It is hard to say which of his later decisions were entirely his and which were the result of such dark whispers or even his own growing insanity. Yet his first steps proved to be a success, at least from his point of view."

With his enemies and their forces occupied and being oblivious of his true intentions, his state troops seized their families and brought them as hostages into the capital. The nobles were outraged but powerless against this threat. Zelos was unmoved by their threats and pleas. After an execution of certain family members just as an example the nobles grudgingly gave in. With raised taxes and tariffs Zelos raised more troops and began to rule with an iron fist. He crushed the orcs and two minor rebellions which he used to justify a demilitarisation of the nobles to quell their strength even further. Zelos also became a collector of magic artifacts, with knowledge of their whereabouts provided to him by his spiritual guides. His insight into the plans of his enemies grew more and more by either spiritual informants or scrying devices he acquired. He now regularly consulted spirits and manifested ghosts as advisors, messengers, bodyguards and even assassins. More and more though, instead of ruling, he could be found mumbling to himself, lost in inner dialogue or arguing with unseen spirits. Soon he became known by his subjects as the ghost king. More and more he withdrew into his tower in the palace, relying more and more on ghostly messengers to communicate with his court. Oddly enough he was a strong supporter of the inquisition, though most claim it was just his reluctance to share his power with anyone. Under his reign the inquisition became twisted and changed, cutting many ties to the churches and been more and more responsible to king and crown. The purges of this inquisition often targeted the very same sources on which he himself once so heavily relied upon and many confiscated talismans and objects found their way into his hands. At some point he shut himself off from the public completely. Yet while he received food and water, his only contact with the outside world took place via ghost messengers or him attending council meetings remotely, due to arcane devices. In the 98th year of his unnatural long reign a still pious branch of the inquisition breached his tower in a coup. No one, save the top members of the inquisition, know what they actually faced in this tower but the day after, king Zelos was declared dead. His successor was yet another young cousin of his. Ilgram had already build up a strong support from the repressed nobility and proved to become a beloved king that renewed the realm to its former glory, casting away the gloom that the ghost king had cast over the land."

        "text": "Baron Eserak was the spiritual leader of a knightly order, devoted to the service of the gods. As a gathering of philosophical and pious men and women, the order often met in debates on spiritual matters. Often such debates lead to heated argument because most members were extremely set in their opinions and points of view in religious matters. Over the time two fractions arose that at least vaguely agreed on crucial points to which the other faction strongly disagreed. Heated debates led to violent arguments and over the time this bred an atmosphere of hatred. When Eserak learned that the opposing faction secretly planned to split he saw his grand plan in danger. He gathered his most loyal and devoted members and lead them in a violent purge of the dissenters. The once wise and serene man had become infuriated about what he saw as the ultimate betrayal and he was not willing to show any mercy. But even after the purge of the order he would not find his peace. The shock of the defection by so many of his former brethren and sisters left him paranoiac. Seeing traitors everywhere he lead several more purges and was driven so far as to burn several of his loyal friends on the base of dubious suspicions. Listening to false advisors his harsh actions lead to the loss of many members, either because they were killed as heretics or because they left the order in disgust. Since the knights of the order hailed from some of the most powerful families of the realm, the schism spilled over into a civil war. The weakened order and their supporters were greatly outnumbered and to restore peace even the crown sided with its enemies. Unwilling to be brought to an - in his eyes heretic - trial, he took his own live before he could be arrested."

They asked me for advice how to deal with the obvious lunatic. They had chained him up in a dark, unused barn. I was quite surprised when while examining the unkempt, dirty man I recognized that this tattered and stained clothes at one time must have been regal and noble. For most times all he would utter were animalistic sounds and growls. I could see how the simple people of the hamlet would assume he was raised by animals or a hermit that had gone mad due to loneliness. With patience and diligence though, I managed to calm him down. Although it took days until the first time, he mumbled something that could be interpreted as words. Sadly from that point on my progress was halted. There was no way to get more out of him, then a few words and even them were rather random. He could be soothed by my words but though the words and phrased he uttered were proof that he knows my language well, he showed no reaction to anything I said, beyond reacting to the tone of my voice. It was as if he'd been trapped in his own mind. Strangely enough 'things' started to happen in his presence. Things moved when not watched, milk turned sour, food rotted away in minutes and I could not get rid of the feeling that sometimes we were watched by some unseen presence. In all his utterings only three things were prominent and consistent. 'The library', 'knowledge' and 'Zathroth' were the words he mentioned most and which usually were followed by screaming, cramps and the aforementioned manifestations. The superstitious villagers first refused to take care of him for a few more days on their own, while I acquired a carriage to bring him to the academy, where he could be examined and treated more appropriately, but I convinced them about my authority and they gave in. When I returned a few days later though, I found the barn a burned down heap."

I'm still not sure what actually happened that night. It could have been some mere accident of course. But it's also quite possible, that the villagers just could no longer bear the cursed man and took things into their own hands. The more disturbing alternative is, that the manifestations that I ignored as chance happenings and vivid imagination had something to do with the fire. The superstitious people had not dared to look for the corpse, so I ordered the men I brought with me to search the rubble. They easily found the bones of the old man, but their findings were utmost disturbing and to this day the thought about what I had seen sends shivers down my spine. The fire had literally left over nothing but bones, which is not just improbable but rather impossible. The bones, though smeared with ashes, were clean of charred flesh. Even the heart that is almost impossible to burn, was gone. Yet that was not what was strange and disturbing about them. The frightening thing was, that his bones were full of runes written in languages even I did not knew. A few of the marks reminded of glyphs in ancient text that were found at the most remote places of the world, remainders of civilizations that had long gone extinct. How in the world would it be possible to treat the bones of a living man like this? I'm absolutely sure none of the villagers tinkered with the bones nor would anyone have the knowledge to forge such complicated scriptures. I took the bones and sent them to the academy for examination, while I continued my delayed travel. Later I learned that the ship that transported them was lost at sea with no clue about its whereabouts. Of course it could have happened by chance. Ships get lost to all kinds of natural hazards. Yet I have to wonder if I had doomed those sailors when entrusting them with this peculiar cargo."

Like other golems some basic tasks can be implemented into their minds, and like parrots they can learn some basic phrases which they, unlike parrots, can use in an intelligent and intentional way. Actually their level of intelligence is only rivalled by certain necromantic golems and constructs that have been created by implanting existing spirits into the constructed body. Their lack of individuality makes it quite easy to control them, which by itself would already classify them as the most useful minions. However, what really lets them shine in the area of artificial servants is the composition of their brain (if the centre of a golem's consciousness can be called that way). Their brain is a certain crystal structure, not too different from the one of the rare crystal golems. Now, the most impressive breakthrough the Yalahari accomplished in the area of golem creation is the duplication of brain patterns from one crystal to another. That way the Yalahari were able to duplicate a certain behaviour of a trained golem into newly created golems. For this reason, newly created golems were almost instantly useful and ready for work. As an interesting side note, the same or at least a quite similar technique was used by the Yalahari to operate certain apparatuses and their so-called factories in which highly modified golems created objects in mass production. The usage of crystals by the ancient Yalahari must have been enormous.\nFor their golems they used the easy controllable mindset of their crystal-stored mind patterns with an endurable and easy producible body of rather cheap metal. For that, they constructed basic metal castings that worked like enormous metal puppets. Using complicated but standardised clockwork mechanisms, they enabled these bodies to use certain forms of movement that usually followed the patterns of natural movement. The movement was amplified by the ingenious usage of physics and metallurgy as well as miniature steam engines.\nSo far the creation of Yalahari golems is comprehensible, even if the mechanic of a golem's body is not fully understood and not reproducible with ordinary metal and alloys. What really baffled the scientific community was the way the two parts, the crystal core or brain and the mechanical clockwork body, worked together. It is quite certain that it has to do with magnetism, electricity and heat but the details are completely unclear. There certainly exists an overall enchantment on the golem but it seems so minor that it is supplementary at best.\nIt seems that in our days no new golems are created anymore, so we must assume that the secret of golem creation might be lost. On the other hand, there is still a great number of existing golems and Yalahari artefacts that can be studied. This might be a chance to either recreate or emulate the process of golem creation which would lead to a tremendous breakthrough in the magical sciences."

        "text": "Lord Lokhem the pious was a good man. In his youth he aimed to become a priest of Banor but later decided he could serve his god better as a knight. He put high standards towards others and even higher standards for himself. Almost no one found his approval. There was always some taint or fault that appalled him in human beings. all the more, however, he was appalled by himself. Whereas in others he could only assume the faults and sins, in himself he was well aware of them. His own anger, envy and greed disgusted him to no end. He felt a great evil was growing deep inside of himself. He studied the teachings of the gods and being unable to find a solution he relied on more and more dubious texts and books. Eventually, drawing from elements of different fragmented texts he devised a ritual that would ultimately cleanse him. By this ritual he planned to cast out his malignant side and destroy it once and for all. The preparations took several years and used up all of his fortune. Eventually he was ready and prepared. On the top of a mountain he scribbled ancient symbols, sung in forgotten languages and consumed elixirs of unspeakable ingredients. Three times three days he endured. In the ninth night at midnight a storm engulfed the mountaintop, without touching it. Amidst darkness and lightning from the ashes of the ritual fires a grotesque creature arose. Lord Lokhems evilness had manifested. Yet to his utter horror it was by far more huge and powerful than the puny remnants of his goodness, in a body that was exhausted by the ritual. His evil mocked him, claiming that this outcome had been its plan all along, to finally be set free. Lokhem valiantly tried to fight back by his dark self only toyed with him. Bleeding from countless wounds Lord Lokhem fell to the ground, powerless. He was still alive when he evil claimed his face for himself. Then it mercilessly slew the good side. It left to lead a life of corruption, spreading mayhem where it went. It is said that Lord Lokhems evil side, driven by memories of his research, was searching a secret library that was rumoured to contain vast knowledge. There he planned to find the spell that would free all the evil in humanity at once and give it substance. But he was overwhelmed by the guardians of the library and met his end by their hands. To honor his accomplishment to find them, the guardians granted him a proper burial."

The queen was displeased but their citziens won't make another try. So the Queen sent the druids to cleanse the area. As their returned weary and wounded and three of them missing they, explained that the area was cursed, haunted and lost for humanity. The queen argued but the druids where adamant in their oppinion. The conclave of druids decided to seal the area with magic wards and maically erected a hedge which they empowered with magic. The queen was not happy but did not intervene to stop them.

They were a constant source of trouble due to their prophecys of doom and frightening the good citizens of thais with their storys. So one of the thaian kings in his generosity gave them a pice of land near the area that later should become known as plains of havoc. The noble king saw it as both, a challenge to the order to proove their seriousness and as a trainingground  to achive even more insight in the workings of fate. Though many did not understand the wise king in those days and plead the order not to leave, the order of the nightmares left the capital and only a few left the order frightened and exeposed as cowards.\nAfter a while more and more warriors flocked to the order and embraced their strange teachings. Most came for the challenge provided by the nearby plains and its monsters, and the order of doom-prophets became more and more a mockery. The king knew they would eventually fail and did not forbid the foolish to join them. In the end the order was extingiushed in some neeadless battle against undead they provoked (probably pursuing some of their dubious prophecies). Still the wise king had long enough put the misguided there as a shield for the newly founded stelement of venore. In the end only the foresight of the clever king came true. The order did fade away as he expected, unable to live up to their loofty goals but at least their misguided energy was not wasted but used to further the prosperity of the thaian realm."

His and Akkors pupils wandered the world and through example and patience spread their words.

Later the dwarf gets to choose a brotherhood (which is a imprecise but common translation of the dwarven term which is far better and  literally translates into 'fellowship'). The more aggressive types would choose the savage axes, a rowdy group of dwarves that has some fame to be easily angered. The more patient (sometimes patient to an extent that drives humans nearly mad) would choose the molten rock fellowship and those that are adventurous and even foolhardy risktakers would join the dragoneaters and so on.

You can use it now just touching it (Right-Click and Use or just Ctrl+click) and then shoot it at the target. The magic will fly from your hand and one of the charges will disappear.

        "text": "Carlin and the rise of the women Vol.1\nIn the begining the Carlin colony was planed as a example of thaian greatness. A city planned by famous architects and built by the finest craftsmen the kingdom could muster. The area was plagued by orcattacks tough and the people and workers became dishearted and afraid. Many left the site for good. So more and more forced labourers and criminals were sent to help in the building process and the finest army of the kindom, the feared 'red legion' was sent as a protective force and to hold the growning number of doubious citizens in check. Seeing the possibility of failure of their greatest project, the royal family of Thais used the growing city of Carlin as a deposit for unwanted thinkers and noble familys that misstepped in the intrigues that plagued the kingdom in those time. Unwanted in the capital but too powerfull to be disposed they were sent to Carlin. Given their wealth and the fertility of the north, the city was not a bad place to live at as long as the legion managed to keep the orcs at bay. Those citizens were joined by some druids that were not comfortable with the power and influence of the thaian sorcerors and their closeness to the royal family. Soon freethinkers and philosophers flocked to carlin and the unrest grew. The focus of the thaian military to internal affairs was increased and the city was ruled with a more iron hand. The governor was not a calm man and seeing the prosperity of the city he got greedy, increasing the taxes to painfull heights. The building of an enourmous castle was begun, a bit northeast of Carlin. Most unfree workers were used for the construction and so soon the city was no longer sufficiently supplied with food. Seeing that only the local druids made it possible to raise enough supplies, the king ordered more druids to travel to carlin, ensuring the supply of the city, the workers and the troops. Still the work progressed slowly."

The women were forced to learn most crafts needed to run the city and joined the druids in gathering and hunting, learning a lot of helpfull skills from those masters of nature. The exiled sister of the thaian king gained more and more influence in the city and soon some huntresses loyal to her cause started nightly supply raids on the bases of the red legion at the buildingsite. With the stolen food she bought favours and supporters in the still starving city (since most supplies went straight to the red legion). Using their newly learned skills of stalking and laying false tracks, the huntresses blamed the orcs of the region with the raids. The plan worked well - too well. The orcs, frightened due to the presence of the famous red legion whose mercyless brutallity was even known to the orcish hordes had not dared to attack or even harras the humans in the carlin area for some time. After a few of those 'orcraids' that could not be prevented the general of the legion ordered a good part of his troops to attack and anihilate the orcish base. Their known base as a islefortress where they thought themselves save. By night, protected by heavy fog the legion used primmitive rafts to cross the sea to the not so far isle. Their attack was a complete surprise. The  orcs were slaughtered. Most of the higher\nranking orcs were not present in the fortress, partaking in a riutal to find a new chieftain and warlord at the other side of the isle. So the orcs, without leadership were easy prey for the experienced legionaires. After their bloody victory the legion hastily tried to travel back to ensure the crimminals did not take that oportunity for a mutiny. Noone knows if it was magic used by vengefull orc shamans (or even by carlin druids as some claim) or just a force of nature, but a storm struck as the legion was crossing the sea a second time."

Unfortunately, these minions still lacked intelligence, and although they were unwaveringly loyal they were of little use to their vile masters. And so it came that the bonelords continued their horrible experiments on living and dead ... They stole souls and implanted them, they switched minds and bodies between the dead and the living, but none of the gruesome experiments ever produced the kind of monstrosity they had in mind. \nEventually they started exposing undead bodies to evil energies and merging them with living beings into massive undead monstrosities, which, however, withered and died almost as soon as they were created. After some experiments that failed in an particularly spectacular manner, the bonelords were forced to abandon their experiments. Soon, their gruesome experiments faded from memory. They had been all but forgotten when a number of braindeath emerged in a remote bonelord city, claiming to have achieved a decisive breakthrough in the field of necromancy. The high council of the bonelord elders reluctantly sent a number of scientists down to the laboratories to examine the results. The undead creatures they found were so hideous and degenerated that the scientists flatly declared that these experiments that led their creation contradicted the very principles of the bonelord race. All undead were to be destroyed and the experiments were to be abolished once and for all.\nThe braindeaths, whose own minds had suffered considerably through years of isolation and of unholy experiments, were enraged by this decision.

        "text": "The Bonelord Threat II\nIt seemed like the bonelords, which were created by the gods as a counterweight to another race that preceded them in the god wars, were unstoppable. But, alas! In the end, they shared the same fate that most other races suffered during the god wars: Yet another race appeared on the scene which proved to be even mightier. They were well protected against the bonelords' magical arsenal, and so it was only a question of time before the bonelords' empire collapsed. The bonelords were replaced by a succession of other races that were chosen by the dark gods to champion their cause. One race followed another, sometimes even before the previous race had become extinct. All the while, the bonelords fared better than most of their successors: Owing to the fact that they had once conquered the whole world, small areas of their civilisation remained even while their once mighty cities disappeared and their mysterious pyramids crumbled to dust. Many bonelords chose to hide below the surface of the world, fighting fierce underground wars to win supremacy over the other races that had fled the surface where the god wars raged on. Their successes were limited, but at least the bonelords managed to establish a number of new subterranean bases, which were safe even though they lacked the grandeur of the bonelords former cities.\nThe bonelords had learnt the bitter lessons from the gruesome wars that had led them to the brink of extinction. They had realised the limitations of their race, and they decided to work on their weaknesses. They found that they had relied too heavily on their intuitive powers in the past, and they decided to improve their innate powers through research and experiments. The dark art of necromancy seemed especially promising, so a group of bonelords concentrated all their efforts towards improving their powers to master the undead."

Their mighty cities, which characteristically contained ominous dark pyramids, could be found all over the world. The bonelords erected them using the same innate form of telekinesis which lets their bodies float in the air. However, they could not do completely without hands and arms that did their bidding. For this reason they relied on another innate power of their race - the dark power of necromancy. Thanks to the magical abilities of their tentacles, which are capable of producing various powerful kinds of magic to an extent that is denied to other races unless they study for many decades, the bonelords also knew how to command the dead. As a result, they used a monstrous strategy: Whenever they conquered an area they turned their unfortunate victims into undead slaves. Using these undead legions as their shock troops, the bonelords went from victory to victory. They built a huge fortress that served as their power base, and from there they went to conquer the world."

        "text": "The Shadows of the Vampires\nThe vampire plague had its origin in mortals dabbling with the dark arts.\nIn the wake of the Corpse War, several humans began practising forms of necromancy for one reason or another.\nSome saw the seemingly overwhelming powers of the undead and desired them for themselves. Others desperately tried to discover some countermeasures for the undead threat.\nResearching for either good or evil, a small cabal of people studying necromancy became infected or cursed, slowly turning them into ghouls themselves. The change was slow enough for the necromancer fledglings to try to avert this change with any means possible. They came up with several methods, mostly based on alchemy. At long last they turned distilled human blood mixed with several forbidden ingredients of demonic origin into an effective potion. Not only did the potion end the rotting transformation, it also revitalised the drinker, making him feel healthier and stronger than ever before. It seemed to be an immediate success.\nAfter the entire cabal received the 'cure' it quickly became obvious that the success was only temporal at best. Soon they began feeling weak. Human food offered them nourishment no more. Again and again they were forced to revert to their potion. Trying desperately to find a permanent cure, they varied the original formula, to no avail.\nTwo of the brightest minds of the cabal finally joined efforts in their research, refusing to let others participate. This slowed them down in their experiments. At long last they came up with a theory that the blood of one of their 'kind' just might be the cure they need.\nInstead of carefully draining themselves and exchanging the blood, they started an argument over who should be the first to be cured. Soon the argument got out of hand, resulting in a fight about who had made the discovery and who deserved the praise. A fight of words turned into a fight of fists, one of them ended up dead and the unwilling donor of the much needed blood.\nThe survivor indeed felt cured, even better than before. He disclosed his research to his fellow necromancers, declaring the death of his colleague an accident. The others were too interested in the cure to truly care, eager to be cured themselves. Though blood was gathered and exchanged it did little to cease the transformation, let alone stop it. The 'cured' necromancer soon figured out the blood had to be taken from a living donor in such a mass and speed that the victim would surely die.\nSecretly he shared this knowledge with his most trusted brethren. They slew the others by night. After the initial shock the victims fought back. More than half of the cabal met its demise in this fight. Only few escaped, doomed to become nearly mindless ghouls.\nThe others learnt soon enough that the supposed cure only stabilised their semi-undead state in some way. Though no longer dependent on complicated alchemical potions, they knew that only the blood of the living would quench their thirst. Also, they were able to infect their victims with some strange strain of their own illness, making them the first true vampires with the attributes and vulnerabilities that are known to us today. It was not possible to recreate the original illness or curse that in combination with several not documented potions initially turned the cabal into unliving things."

All were futile. As this was recognized it was almost too late. All magic was concentrated to preserve the lives of the elves. Protective shells were created, spells to deflect damage, enchantements to keep harm away.\nThe 'return' was aweful. Almost half of the elves perished. All of the valley and its wonders were destroyed. Almost nothing remained. Artifacts and books shattered and burnt alike. The battered elves retreated and begun to wander aimlessly through the lands, until they encountered scouts of the Deraisim who led them to the safety of their woods. At first they were disgusted by the primitive lifestyle of their brethren, but soon they decided they had to guide and lead them back to true values of elvenkind. So one of their encampements was choosen as new home for the elvenkind and the city of Ab'Dendriel was founded."

The siblings were motivated by their competition towards each other. Whatever one of them achieved, the other tried to outdo. They excelled in the athletic arts and it is said that they surpassed their combat instructors constantly soon after they were replaced by more competent ones. They achieved knighthood in an early age and joined the army in numerous campaigns against the orcs and fought valiantly in the outlaw wars. As times of peace didn't suit them well, they went on daring quests and pitted themselves against some of the most fearsome monsters of the land. They killed the two-sided hydra, the three headed dragon of Cormaya, the ancient vampire of Senja and the abominable beast of Guddenwood. On tourneys they were only bested by each other, with either brother claiming similarly frequent victories. Legend has it that their excellence lead to a great deal of vanity with a hint of cruelty. Though they acquired many admirers, they rarely made friends. Their casual cruelty and insulting arrogance caused wounds and created trenches over the years. But the brothers did not care. It seemed they needed only each other and despised the company or even presence of strangers. According to the laws of those days they had a certain leeway how to handle the affairs of their estates and legend tells that they were cruel masters whose subjects often were left dead or maimed for the slightest failures. The treatment of their subjects lead to many wanting to flee their lands to which the bothers responded with a peculiar death penalty for anyone caught in the act. They did not outright kill them, but made them target of a hunt in which they were chased down without having a true chance to escape. Over the years the number of their enemies and contenders swell. One day when they were on their way home from a victory feast, still halve drunk and spent from their previous battle, they were waylaid by a coalition of their enemies and their forces. Although the brothers fought even long after their whole retinue had been slaughtered, eventually weariness took its toll and one of the brothers slipped on the floor that had long turned into bloody mud. Immediately his opponents were upon him and took his life. The other brother went into a frenzy, fighting like a madman. It is said, he might even have won the battle against all odds had he not in the end allowed his dying foes to stab him, for he lost his reason to live."

        "text": "The Shiron'Fal is an organization that seems to predate the dawn of mankind. A time of constant strife and warfare gave birth to a fledgling organisation of dishevelled but powerful individuals. The original purpose of this pact was probably as mundane as pooling resources for survival but it soon became something more meaningful and sinister. The first members seem to have been some of the last remnants of their race that perished in the god wars. Each of them brought a unique set of skills and talents that quickly added up in power. With the imminent danger of annihilation averted, the group soon consolidated it's power and reasserted their goals. They were probably genuinely surprised by the success their alliance has had and began to hunger for more. Inspired by the synergy their diversity created, they began to look for individuals of power that could provide something beneficial to the group. Over the centuries the scope of their ambitions broadened. They began not only to acquire new members but also powerful artifacts and minions. All the while they operated in the shadows. Making their hidden moves, manipulating people and events, taking whatever they needed to increase their power. Their agents travelled the world in many forms and disguises, looking for relics and recruits. If a target was identified, a powerful member of the Shiron'Fal made its move with deadly efficiency. What could not be taken by guile was taken by force. For the most parts of history, though, the organisation seemed more like a sleeping giant. Waking up now and then, making some devastating moves, only to vanish into obscurity once again. During the last centuries the actions of the pact have become more consistent and frequent. Why there was this increase in activity is yet to be determined. What can be said, however, is that their process of recruitment has been broadened and now also aims at the most powerful specimens of certain races or supernatural beings. Sometimes the organisation has plotted to pit such individuals against perilous odds to determine their worth.\nIn the most recent history they can be made responsible for events like the discovery of several powerful vampires and the rise of werekin activity on Feyrist. A more personal action of the legion was the presence of one of their members in Rathelton, seeking for an object of power and the attempt to subvert the elven courts of summer and winter to free and recruit or enslave the nightmare beast that was bound by them.\nThe ancient term Shiron'Fal roughly translates in something along the lines of \"dread legion\" or \"army of the last days\". More literal the words translate into \"numerous, military organisation\" and vaguely describe a special time of reckoning. This might give a hint of their ultimate purpose. Some assume all their efforts are aimed at a final battle for all of creation. Others think it rather hints at the ultimate goal to conquer or destroy everything as soon as they accumulated enough power. Some even claim a renewal of the god wars is their ultimate goal.\nYet most about the Shiron'Fal is shrouded in mystery. Even the most basic information like a base of operation, the number of members or even the names from more than a few of them are unknown. Not even the structure of organisation is apparent, although there are strong hints that an enigmatic single entity is in lead of the legion."

In life they do many damnable things for their dark gods, burdening their souls to such an extent that they will most likely rise as ghosts if the dark gods do not claim their souls.\nIn some cases where the soul has been claimed, the hollow spirit still captured within the dead soulless body can utilise the dark energies of the corpse and animate it.\nJust as an undead being is controlled by a necromancer, the vampire is merely a shell controlled by the spirit residing within.\nThe spirit constantly needs to refresh the dark energy he is using up and is in dire need for a substitute for the soul. Additional special circumstances such as holy ground or sunlight amplify the rate in which the dark energies decrease. To substitute this, the vampire is forced to steal the souls of the living.\nThe easiest way for him to accomplish this is by stealing the blood of living humans. The blood normally contains some amount of soul energy, however, a vampire is able to force more soul energy into it's victims blood while feeding.\nIn his own dead shell the vampire transforms the stolen soul energy into new dark energy. This process keeps him in existence. Over the years, the entire body only consists of dark energy residue and slowly turns into a shadow with substance.\nIf the vampiric body is destroyed, the spirit within becomes entrapped in the remains. Helpless it is cursed to wait for enough dark energy to accumulate in order to be able to recreate the shadow body in some way. Given time and sacrifices, a vampire might slowly rise from the state of apparent destruction to once again haunt the mortals.\nAnother possibility is that the remains are close to some source of dark power, giving off enough pure dark energy to occasionally haunt the dreams of the living or to form a ghostly body to steal the life breath of sleepers in the vicinity of the vampires' corpse. This process might take longer but will still lead to the vampires' resurrection.\nThe only way to irrevocably destroy a vampire is a blessed stake. The stake will destroy the evil spirits' ties to our world and send it into hell screaming."

They almost ducked under some unseen power, the deafening screaming of the dead became a frightened whisper. And then we saw IT! It was a mummy, aeons old and addorned with jewelry worth a kingdom. Slowly it aproached us, its undead minions ducking in fear to his feet. A moment it stood still and its faceles head seemed to muster us. I dared not to breath, the glance of the mummy seemed to stain my soul with rot and evil. I heaed my heart beating. Then the mummy slowly lifted its arm, pointed at us and spoke 'chamek ath uthul arak!' The priest of Fardos who was with us and survived that nighmarish ordeal later told us it means 'sacrifice your blood' in some ancient language of an extinct race. Of course we did not know how to react and noone would have given this godscursed creature even the dirt under our fingernails anyways. After a moment of silence the mummy raised its hands again and with anger yelled but one word: 'Kadash!' I did not need a linguist to translated that. It meant 'attack'.

        "text": "We confirm that the Ruthless Seven have occupied the place which is known as Pits of Inferno. With the help of divination, we were able to see that they channelled their dark essence to some remote place in our world for unknown reasons. We could not figure out this place, though. It cannot be emphasised enough that it is extremely important to find this place and if possible, to destroy it.\nIt is certain that the gate from our world to the demon realm, which is situated somewhere in the pits, is currently inactive. It works similar like a volcano. Sometimes there is some activity there, most of the time nothing happens at all, but occasionally there is a tremendous eruption.\nWe assume that the last major eruption coincided with the destruction of the Nightmare Knights. Several earlier reports of increased demonic activity overlap with eruptions, too.\nThree things can be concluded from our observations: Firstly, the demons have no control over these eruptions, though they try to be as active as possible whenever an eruption occurs.\nSecondly, the demons cannot foresee the dates of these eruptions. For this reason, coordinated efforts to make use of the eruptions are delayed.\nThirdly, eruptions are not stable enough to support a longer campaign without risking the stranding of many powerful demons in our world like fish on dry land.\nThe worst thing that could happen is that a large amount of less powerful demons is breaching into our world to stay here permanently. They will have some guidance by their leaders as long as the eruption lasts. Once the eruption comes to an end, the demonic leaders will retreat to their realm, leaving a chaotic and rampaging demon army in our world.\nAs long as the pits were defended by the Nightmare Knights, who must have known previously when an eruption would occur, the demons could be fought back while they were still materialising and thus, most vulnerable. Now that the pits are lost and overrun by demonic hordes, an attack becomes more and more likely.\nThere was no massive demonic invasion in the past, and probably there won't by any in the future. If the demons had had such a possibility, they would have used it. At least some archdemons would have grabbed the chance, and a cabal such as the Ruthless Seven surely has the power to attack our world while defending its position in its own realm. It is surely no lack of ambition that keeps the demons from raiding us, there must be other forces that have prevented such an attack so far.\nEven before the creation of the humans, there have been several occurrences that can only be interpreted as attacks by demonic armies trying to stop the creation process. Inhuman sources tell of several armies that invaded our world in the course of many centuries.\nMost of these invasions could be tracked to some unholy centre of magic. From there immense forces were evoked to open a gate through which the demonic armies entered our world.\nThe gate was opened, an army passed through, and the gate eventually closed again. The invading armies had no supplies and were finally destroyed. The demonic leaders made only rare appearances on the battlefield, probably summoned by their minions for a while. So contrary to common belief, it seems possible that a large demonic army enters our world if certain conditions are met. It should be our top priority to find out what conditions this may be."

This is what I am\nmissing!  He thought, and walked\nslowly up to the man (as it is not\nwise to run up to a man carrying an\naxe, especially if you're already\na swamp troll.)\nBut the man did not appear alarmed,\nand invited Forfer into his\nbeautiful red-roofed house for some\ncookies.  Forfer happily obliged,\nand they struck up a conversation\nabout houses and fish.

The frost, who was quite tired from his long walk, could not resist and fell asleep. Quickly Marl put his hand into the frost's chest and stole his heart. With the heart in his hands, Marl also had the powers of the frost. So he constructed himself a palace completely made of ice and ruled over a land where every day was spring. As the the neighbouring king heard about this, he got envious and decided to invade the kingdom of Marl with his army. But Marl's people were peaceful and were not trained in any fighting. So the army reached the castle of Marl almost unchallenged. And Marl came out of the castle, pleading the army to leave. But they laughed at him and demanded his surrender. Then Marl took the frost's heart and threw it to the ground where it shattered. In that very moment everything on both realms was frozen with a thick layer of ice and each and everyone died. And the frost returned to power, but without a heart he was even more merciless than before."

        "text": "Animated fathers are usually created as simple golems that serve as copyists and automated scribes. Unspectacular and not sentient on their own, they are mere tools for powerful magicians. There are rumours, though, of ancient feathers that copied so many arcane texts, that some of the knowledge gradually accumulated in them. Slowly but steadily they grow in power and sentience. Eventually they acquired some sort of self awareness. Becoming less of a tool and more of a being, they grew less useful for their original purpose. At some point they are pulled from their copy duties and act more like librarians. Their main function becomes to contain dangerous knowledge with the use of their acquired skills in glyphs and wards. Still they are obsessed with their original purpose and copy random books in their spare time, accumulating more and more knowledge in the process. They are highly skilled in the use of arcane sigils but in the time of need and urgency they rather employ spontaneous bursts of the magic they acquired. Even when protecting themselves or their libraries, they still act more like emotionless constructs reacting on a more practical base. Their fighting style might also best be described as 'efficient'. It takes an extremely long time for an animated feather to display some kind of personality. Most perish to the teeth of time and accidents. The few that endure can become quite intelligent, even quirky. Rumour has it, that a few feathers authored books on their own, not even just compiled knowledge they acquired but genuinely new and creative works with astounding insights. At least one extremely old animated feather chose to author books of comedic limericks while another specialized on acclaimed love poems."

        "text": "Energetic books were originally a race of shapechanging demons that planned to infiltrate Zathroth's hidden hoard of knowledge to steal enough of it to topple the demon princes and rule on their own. Cunning and knowledgeable they snuck their way through wards and wardens. With trickery and their shapeshifting powers they wormed their way into the heart of secrets. The knowledge they coveted so much was almost at their grasp. Though Zathroth might have seen the effort as admirable, their plot was revealed by his librarians and ultimately thwarted. Before they could finalise their coup, they were cornered, revealed and overpowered. Desperately they made a plea they were doing only Zathroth's work and therefore were not guilty but only zealous, for all they wished for was power through secret knowledge. It is said that the god himself spoke the final verdict on the fiends and forced them into the form of the books they tried to steal. He also bound them to the service of his librarians and to aid them through all eternity. The demons not only retained their original power but indeed were somewhat alleviated by the transformation. So in some way the dark god might have granted them a part of their wish. In the eons since then some aspiring spellwielders managed to summon and bind a few of the energetic books to their will. Most of them are said to be still bound to the holy places of Zathroth, serving as guardians, messengers and even power sources for certain twisted experiments. Little of their ambitious egos remained after all the centuries of servitude. All that's left of them is eagerness to see others suffer too. Their numbers might have declined over the centuries but still there are many of the once proud race around, disgraced, enslaved and with the hatred of centuries to be unleashed on any foolhardy creature they might be sent after."

        "text": "The brain squids are one of the upper castes of the squid race. Since they are also the most often encountered outside of their home territory, the whole telepathic race has often mistakenly been coined as brain squids. Their purpose is to form a telepathic network that processes information and commands for others of their race. The exchange between individuals intensifies due to proximity and if enough brain squids are close enough to each other, they become a collective entity that overrides each individual. The thoughts of other, 'lesser' members of their species in the vicinity are shut down and they only function as mere extensions and tools of the collective. With the help of the luminous squid cast, they are even able to control the minds of weak willed individuals of other species and make them do their bidding. Like others of their race, they follow the teaching of Zathroth in their own, twisted ways and can sometimes be found amongst other followers of their god. Whether they serve as spies, watchmen or advisors is hard to tell. It is them who create the extreme breeding programmes of their species. If the need arises they come up with a new caste to fit into any new position and initiate the breeding processes that might require much time and many generations to come to pass. This makes the race as a whole somewhat inflexible and dependent on allies. Their inbreed disdain for other races that follow no breeding procedures at all makes it hard for them to find any allies. This lead to their sorcerer class to form pacts with demons and heavy reliance on the assistance by the cult of Zathroth. In turn they provide the cult with capable overseers and fighters, when the need arises and it is said that if that is the case, there is secret breed at their disposal which could prove devastating to their opponents or enemies of Zathroth."

Seekers and preservers of knowledge to the core of their very essence is bound to the principles of Uman-Zathroth. The energuardians are extremely intelligent, with several independent brain spheres that by choice can work separately or in unison. They are constantly occupied with several projects at once and only a few spheres of them sleep at the same time. Even in face of mortal threat they are usually distracted by 'more urgent' matters. Still dangerous and powerful, it's hard to tell what potential an energuardian could unleash, if he'd ever focussed on a single issue like a fight.\nThough in general very reasonable, the energuardians are also devout followers of Zathroth and very strict in heeding their obligations. They are aware of their status, power and knowledge and behave extremely arrogant and dismissive towards other races and underlings.\nEach of them possesses a unique personal book that is no book at all but rather a scrying device which can display the contents of any other book it memorised and access books stored in the personal book of another energuardian within a certain radius. Each of those books is connected to the books of each other guardian and through willpower they can send written messages to the books of other energuardians. This form of communication has become so popular to their kind, that it completely replaced spoken language within their whole race. Only reluctantly they use their underdeveloped speech organs to communicate with lesser creatures."

        "text": "Most icecold books are creations of a long gone race of cryomancers. This race casted their spells always with the books as conduit and amplifier. Therefore they bound powerful spirits of frost and ice into their tomes. The levitating books accompanied them as companions and tools at once. With the vanishing of their creator race, the icecold books became inert. Hungry for the knowledge contained in them, they were stolen and experimented upon. The only way found to unleash their considerable power, was to empower them with a will of their own and bind certain arcane crystals attuned to icemagic into them as an energy source. Thus the books became self-sustained entities that had access to at least some of the ancient spells bound to them. They follow an icecold, yet somewhat malignant logic and can be reasoned with to some degree. Since their creators seemed to have had some deeper connection to Zathroth, they easily ally with his forces. Still they act on their own and might behave strongly unpredictable. Almost indistinguishable from them are newer creations that were attempts to recreate them with modern magic. Though less powerful and less intelligent, these copies are highly obedient to their creators but contain no bound knowledge on their own. Instead they use an array of frost abilities that work more with a brute force method than artfully woven magic like the originals. They are used to provide a reliable source of ice magic, that doesn't drain the mana reserves of its owner. Both versions can be found as status symbols of powerful casters. It is said that a high number of originals was collected and stored away by followers of Zathroth but even they were unable to unlock the final secret knowledge contained in them."

This lead to an extreme specialised cast-like system in which the squid warden served as a kind of police force. Favouring secret knowledge as source of power, they follow a complex set of rules and laws that are not commonly known. They are often found patrolling extremely important and holy places dedicated to Zathroth and his principles. Bread as enforcers they have a formidable array of offensive powers, can not be bribed and hardly reasoned with. They seamlessly blend magic and their natural telepathy with frightening efficiency and seem impervious to pain thanks to their willpower. Due to their for outsiders incomprehensible behavior patters that follow their own secret rules, they are not well-liked by other Zathroth worshipers.\nThe higher ranks in the cult, however, employ them nonetheless and willingly accept a few casualties in the own ranks when someone breaks the unspoken rules of the wardens. Though able to communicate with others than their own race, they almost never lower themselves to argue with or explain themselves to other creatures, which they see only with contempt. Way more than others of their kind, they see other races not following purposeful breeding cycles, as random abominations that should be eradicated. They have an unexplainable weakness for music though and sometimes can be soothed by it. The kind of music the squid warden fancies however, would be considered cacophonic by other beings, so finding the 'right tune' to please them is rather impossible."

Some works become like entities on their own and begin to feed on the energy of their creator.\nSometimes they consume even more energy than a mere arcane book can contain. Such overloaded books begin to 'bleed' out some of the lifeblood and essence they contain in the form of magic ink. While a single book can merely produce some inconsequential droplets of soul-ink, a large number of books that provide such ink might pool into a greater blob.This combined essence quickly gains a form of sentience of their own and feeds on lesser pools to grow in size and power.\nSince they become very protective towards the books that spawned them and they still feel some kind of mystical connection to. they are usually rather seen as useful than just a mere nuisance, though they are always quite hostile towards strangers.\nSince in theory they can absorb unlimited amounts of essence pools and grow to abominably sizes, they are commonly culled by the keepers of the libraries that spawn them and split into lesser, better manageable blobs of smaller size. The refreshment of fading inks in old books, destruction of vermin as well as mold and keeping the pages at the ideal state of dryness counts to their more usual functions. They tend scare away some nosy intruders and keep visitors out of areas they are unwanted in. While relatively 'newborn' ink blobs are timid and react to strangers with scary faces and bubbly noises older, more experienced blobs, become considerably more aware of their own capabilities and grow more and more aggressive and malignant."

Sometimes wannabe magicians try their luck on spells way out of their league with typically dramatic consequences. Most such misfortunes lead to the untimely death of the vain caster in spectacular fashion, sometimes, however, it happens that some lesser demon is partly summoned and melts into the book containing the spell by absorbing the life force of the unfortunate reader. Such demon-book conglomerates can become enormously powerful by harnessing the knowledge contained in the book, demonic forces and whatever might be left of the casters memories and fractured soul. For their raw power and potential but also for their contained knowledge, such cursed books are hunted down by Zathroths librarians and bookkeepers and dragged away to some sinister place of forbidden knowledge. There they are trained, their skills honed and they become part of Zathroth's collection and serve as his guardian dogs to protect other secrets. Perhaps because of the way of their unwilling creation, cursed books feel nothing but spite, contempt and hatred against living beings. Sometimes they even plot to incite mortals to follow their own foolishness and use spells beyond their power. Whether they do so to create more of their kind or just to enjoy the misery of others can't be told for sure. Most of them just skip such subtlety and attack anything not allied to them or their masters with all of the raw power available to them."

The legs took my body by themselves seeking the unknown reason of my discomfort. Went north until I saw a strangely familiar dungeon. Torch ignited, carefully entered the hostile cave. Putrid air filled my lums. Howls, grunts and screams echoed through the cold, damp stone walls. I\u2019ve walked those paths for hours finding nothing and the torch, slowly, fading.\nAround a corner, I witness a grotesque scene whose invoked my most primordial fears. My head boiled again and in an involuntary reflex I gritted my teeth. The beast that was feeding on the deceased man noticed and attacked me. \u201cKAPLAR!\u201d shout the half-human, half-bovine. A nature\u2019s nefarious breed. Fear, disgust and anger fulfilled my mind. A bullseyed stomp cracked the shield and made me hit backwards against a wall. He thumped his hooves on the ground and rushed to the final blow. Instinctively, I moved a few inches causing him to thrust his sharp horns into the stone walls. My sword found a space between two of his ribs and I felt it vibrating at the touch of the heart that still beated few times before no more.\nRelieved, I looted the monster and went to the deceased man. \u201cHe\u2019s dead anyway\u201d, I though and turned his body towards me.\nMy head exploded in excruciating pain. I closed my eyes and screamed loudly and kneeling on agony! Eyelids opened, I saw myself still screaming, but through the dead\u2019s eyes! He was me!\nThe desperate cry echoed through the walls. Suddenly, I felt a small tremor. A horde approached! Back to myself, I was ready to protect my remains and old boots at all costs. Torches appeared on the corner. In front of the pack, a similar creature, but wearing a purple robe, a wand and followed by hyenas. White flash.\nOnce comforting words of Cipfried had little impact on my mind this time.

        "text": "Roshamuul Exploring\nI was an Elite Knight, promoted by King Tibianus himself, and I was given the task to explore the new island called Roshamuul and report my findings. I was the leader of a group known to always prevail and never surrender, so we were the obvious choice for the job.\nAfter months of hard work and lots of lives lost, my team was able to build the Roshamuul bridge. Little did we know what dangers were expecting us ahead. We were afraid, but our will to uncover the secrets of this new and dangerous place prevailed and in no time a group of the best warriors discovered a seemingly impenetrable wall, deep inside the valley.\nI was leading that group, and with the healing power of two of the finest druids in the realm, I was able to advance to the east, arriving in a gruesome cemetery with Guzzlemaws hiding behind every corner. We discovered piles of bones containing some special horns, which had magical properties \u2013 blowing on them started weakening the great Roshamuul wall. We left the valley that day feeling that real progress was being made, and back on the main camp we told everyone about our discoveries.\nThe next day, I sent some powerful man to protect the wall surroundings, and went straight to the eastern part of the valley \u2013 but I felt something was wrong right away. I didn't know what it was, but I felt a shiver down my spine the moment I entered the cemetery. There weren\u2019t many creatures there, only a few hiding in the bone piles. There was an unnatural silence, like even the dreadful creatures there were afraid of something.\nThat is when I heard a scream: a mage in the back was lying dead on the ground, crushed by a stone. Behind him was an enormous creature, heavily armored and with a single huge eye. I told my party members to stand ground, but more of the creatures started showing from every direction, until we were overwhelmed. I was able to block four of them, but everyone panicked and just fled \u2013 they finally surrendered. As I was dying, the only thing I could think of was my failure and how reckless I was.\nAs the time passed by, my name was forgotten, but the creature\u2019s name was immortalized as the Sight of Surrender."

This is an ambush.\nI managed to get to my feet, as well as get a firm grip on my fire sword, I pierced through the dwarfs armor and struck him through the heart, killing him instantly.\nThe battle was not done yet. I used my dusty rope and climbed out of this hole, only to find a small army of dwarves who were waiting for me. I begged them to let me pass, but they would not agree.\nGripping my Sword I struck them down one by one. Until there were no more. To this day, that has been the hardest battle I have ever encountered. I did it.\nI survived.\nI could barely walk. with my fire sword sheathed I picked up my prize. The pickaxe.\nWalking out of there, the minutes felt like days. Blood and sweat dripped onto my brow from underneath my helmet.\nThere it was. The light.

It is only moments after being welcomed into this exciting world of ours that the inexperienced human deems himself ready to hunt his first prey. Anxious to shed blood, the inexperienced human completely abandons all semblance of common sense and immediately goes rushing towards the sewers below our little village, intending to slay some of the rodents residing there. \u201cThose puny rats... ha!\u201d the inexperienced human scoffs. \u201cWhat chance could such tiny creatures possibly stand against a handsome and able-bodied fellow such as myself?\u201d Little does the inexperienced human know what awaits him on the other side of that sewer grate, however, and it is not long before it becomes abundantly clear that the first of his many follies was that of not bringing a torch to illuminate the path before him. Lacking the intelligence to understand when to retreat, the inexperienced human instead starts feeling his way deeper and deeper into the pitch-black cave until eventually stumbling upon a crossroads of sorts. \u201cIn which direction shall I head now?\u201d the inexperienced human asks himself indecisively, but oh no, what's that? Have the rats which the inexperienced human was so eager to find cruelly taken advantage of his minor act of hesitation by cornering him? It would appear so, dear readers, and now consider closely the inexperienced human's reaction. Trapped and struggling to land satisfactory blows on his hairy enemies, the inexperienced human's first instinct is to accuse his weapon of conspiring against him. His second, after realising that his relentless opponents are inflicting considerable damage on his ankles, is to descend into utter despair. \u201cWhatever have I done to deserve this grim fate?\u201d the inexperienced human cries out to our benevolent gods. Wallowing in self-pity and drained of all willpower, the inexperienced human ultimately yields to his adversaries with a broken spirit. Death being inevitable by this point, I am never surprised to see members of this foolish species appear beside me once again."

        "text": "The Tricked Trickster\nOnce upon a time, in the long-forgotten lands of Nova, there was a young and promising sorceress. While very cunning, her yearning for riches often got her in trouble. She got expelled from the Ivory Towers of Edron following the disappearance of several wondrous artifacts. Penniless, the teen rascal got to Thais as a stowaway. She devised a series of swindles that allowed her to hold up, although it was never enough. She was infatuated with legendary treasures brought to Thais by merchants, recovered from the deepest dungeons of Tibia.\nNecessity is often the mother of invention, and so she brought forth her master heist. All it took was a wealthy adventurer, a dark alley, and her vile wits. The sorceress would boost the unwary hero\u2019s ego with flattery. Then she would ask the adventurer to show his belongings, ideally the most prodigal item of his arsenal. Next, she would summon mystical fires to engulf the treasures. The heroes would be startled, unable to reach their belongings, now buried by flames. Killing her was often discarded by the victims, doing so in the middle of the city was often a bad idea. Removing the flames required a specific rune spell, one that most did not carry with them. She was obviously in possession of the rune, so the witty thief only had to hide, wait for the victims to run for help and collect the treasures. Dozens fell for the trick and soon enough she got quite rich.\nThis success got the attention of other thieves, as well as praise amongst her fellow bandits. One of them, nicknamed \u201cThunderfingers\u201d, dared the now prideful sorceress to bet on her most valuable possession in a contest for speed. She accepted right away. The most infamous thieves of Thais met in a dark street as witnesses. Both contestants betted on a demon helmet, a rarity stolen from the depths of Hell. The idea was to place it in a pedestal between the challengers. The quickest to retrieve it would be the winner.\nThe sorceress was ready, confident, and placed the helmet on the pillar with ceremony. Immediately after, a torrent of dark magic struck her. The last thing she saw before the gods claimed her wicked soul was \u201cThunderfingers\u201d grinning at his accomplices. As she passed, she understood that he never intended to play fair. Just like she ever did."

        "text":"A page of Goshnars manifest: \nAs shown, in theory there are many ways to imbue a dead creature with immense power (see chapters 22 to 24). When one combines sorcerous and spiritual means the result should be extraordinary. The idea here is, that you can use sorcery to turn a suitable being into a lich-like being under your control (see lich-thralls, chapter 15). If such a creature is already imbued with some kind of spirituality (that is: in the process of ascending, as shown in chapter 7) both powers would add up. While this is a neat little parlour trick, it's more for prestige then for power, since the subject, though formidable, won't be able to access its spiritual potential at all. Here is the catch, however. Due to the law of transcended identity, several such creatures could be used to focus their powers into a higher, slightly more spiritually potent being of the same kind. In layman's terms you could say, you bundle their power into one recipient. If this bundled power reaches a certain threshold, the metaphysical adaption actually burns a new spiritual power level into the recipient. We have seen such acts in which mass sacrifices of fanatic cult followers helped certain leaders to ascend to some degree. For the purposes of necromancy it means we could easily bundle the power of several lesser undead into one of greater power. Now this comes with several problems though. Raw power isn't transferred well. It simply overrides former power levels. So while you could create one decent zombie by sacrificing a hoard of zombies, it would still be a zombie, fragile and weak. The sorcerous levels at least somewhat add up. So if you create several lich-thralls (see chapter 15) you can combine them into one with more sorcerous power than the individuals have. Now the spirituality comes into play. The spiritual level is in reality a level of ascension (see chapter 7). The problem is, normal ascension is bound to the soul rather than to the body. Since we have created lich-thralls, we have no real souls at our disposal but are dealing with false-souls (see chapter 13). They lack any level of spirituality at all. Yet there is a way the ascension is residual in a dead body, when said person was immensely revered or feared in life. This non-native ascension isn't inherent to the soul but to the person of the recipient, in this case the bodily remains. So a person that was revered in life has some remainder of ascension left in the body. If it was famous and well-remembered the energy lingers on for longer. This leads to the possibility of creating lich-thralls based on heroes of legend. While a single one would have only the powers as to be expected from such a creature, you can now combine them into another, greater hero (a transfer to a lesser level of ascension would simply not work). With the fusion of spirituality in this creature, a new level of ascension would be created. Mind you, it's not a true ascension and although there is an immense increase in personal power, it's actually just tricking some laws of nature. A true and ultimate ascension is not possible by such means. But for the purpose of a potentially immensely powerful thrall, this is ideal of course. However you will need quite a lot of such semi ascended heroes. Experiments showed that the critical mass for the ascension fusion is rather high. Too many sources, however, create an incompatibility loop, that usually destroys all subjects involved. So you have to aim at a decent number of properly powerfully imbued individuals. Even with great heroes you need at least four sources and things start to go awry at about 12 individual sources. The sweet spot seems to be using 7 subjects. That lowers the possibility of the fusion and introduces negative effects due to incompatilities."

        "text":"Private property of Logur, Forgemaster of the Planegazers\n<Expedition Project 'Exclave', Scientific Site XIV>\n<Private Notes>\n\nOur shared goal is in jeopardy. The council has sealed off most of the sites by now. We are trying to gather enough information from this one to be able to move on. Unfortunately, most of the useful equipment has already been withdrawn, right after decoding (the following paragraph looks as if it has been hastily effaced). We are basically working with sticks and stones here.\nI will file a report concerning recent regulation changes and the conditions under which we have to operate. My complaints will be sent to the council as soon as we leave this post. Our mission is indeed clear, secrecy is highly advised. However, right now all this does is to hinder our progress. I am beginning to think there is something more at work here. Why are so many sites closed in a hurry, why does it seem the council nowaddays confuses giving advice with issuing orders, and caution with secret-mongering? I shall keep these thoughts to myself. All those doubts may unsettle my colleagues and that would be nothing but counterproductive.\nOur detailed findings have been recorded (note: Compendium Site XIV). The state of the forge is operational. On a more personal note I want to express my concerns concerning our current situation. We all know the directive in case of an 'Erasure', which will undoubtedly be upon us in a matter of days. However, our time window is far too narrow. While most of the equipment is already off site (compare with my notes from the first paragraph), I highly doubt we will be able to move the forge itself in time. We have gathered all remaining devices from this site and can only hope that all other teams have followed the directive to the letter. Should an outsider come into the possession of a leftover device, with the forge still active I cannot guarantee that this individual can be kept from deciphering what we found. Mechanical contraptions will advance over time and nothing will be safe. We shall heed our principle for we are without guide if we do not. Or as they always say: \"Shroud your knowledge, veil the end.\""

They possess four arms and are able to use all of them simultaneously - be it to fish, weave, wield weapons or perform special gestures called yukti to cast spells. They typically hold their heads and torsos off the ground while moving, but they can increase their speed by lowering their bodies. On their torsos they like to wear beautiful silken clothes or ornate armour as well jewelry like rings, bracelets and bangles on their arms. The lower snake body is usually free of clothing, but will be protected with armour if necessary. Nagas are resistant to poison and have a natural affinity for spellcasting, being born with an inherent understanding of the art of magic. Much like most snake and reptile species, they dislike cold climates.\n\nNagas are an old, powerful and proud race who live on the jungle island Marapur since several millennia and built up a remarkable culture there. Their cities are said to be filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures. Their power makes them potentially dangerous to humans. However, many of them act rather benevolent towards the two-legs, as they call the humanoid races. If they are hostile and aggressive, there is always a good reason, be it obvious or not."

When nearing the island, high mountains are the first shapes that become visible on the horizon. Lush gras and jungle-like vegetation covers the lowlands. On the coastal lines, the land is partially flooded by water. Small islets surround the island, just like ice floes surround large icebergs. Cause for this partial flooding is the very slowly rising sea level that has been going on for centuries. The island provides the prefect living environment for the Nagas. Nagas are devided into two factions: On the one hand, there are nagas living in the coastal regions. They have integrated the rising sea level perfectly into their way of living. They call it the Rising and take advantage of the moist and watery surroundings rather than trying to prevent any flooding. On the other hand, there are nagas living in the mountains. They have not been affected, yet, by the Rising. Due to the different living conditions, there are some cultural and religious differences between these two groups. The different lifestyle results in different customs, as well as different food preferences. These difference are no reason for any open conflict, though tensions do occur."

They are more powerful because they can combine more yukti at the same time to cast more powerful spells.\n\nThe solid water is a secret only known to the naga. It has roundish, organic shapes, like waves that have solidified in motion. It can also take the appearance of large drops or water bubbles. The solid water is very receptive to magical energy and therefore often enchanted. In the past, at the beginning of the Rising, these elements were mainly used to push back the water by casting repulsion spells on them. For now, they are used for a wide variety of purposes, partly to direct and guide water and to collect it in certain places, but also for entirely different purposes. And sometimes the solid water is only used for aesthetic decoration."

        "text":"The Fall of the Moon Goddess\n\nSince the beginning of our existence, we have worshiped the moon goddess Amati. She always stood high in the sky, looking down on us benevolently and lighting up the nights. Although we love the warmth of the sun, it is the moon that moves the sea, creating the tides. It is the moon that can charge solid water with energy. That strengthens our magical powers. We think of the moon as a queen and the stars as her many maids. But once, in her wanderings across the night sky, Amati took a misstep and fell. She plummeted down, right above Marapur and landed in the Stardance Mountains. Hurt and alone, she didn't know how to get back up into the sky. And the stars missed her bitterly. Moon and stars shed many tears and mourned many nights - dark nights, without Amati's light in the sky. But then the stars decided to do something they had never done before: they descended from the sky and surrounded the fallen moon. They began a magical dance. And lo and behold, Amati was healed and, with the help of the stars, she was able to rise into the sky again. This is why the mountains in the center of Marapur are called the Stardance Mountains and our city here Moonfall. For it was at this very spot that Amati had fallen."

They know when schools of fish come close to the coasts, making it a good time for fish. And they can estimate which islands will be affected by the Rising soon. The wave shapers are a kind of water-magicians who can create solid water, charge it with magic and also transform it into other forms. They have a sort of water-empathy that allows them to solidify the water and then shape it as if it were soft wax. Another profession is that of beaver whisperers. The nagas use the island's giant beavers as beasts of burden to transport timbers, star leaf and other material. These beavers are taken care of by the beaver whisperers, who build a trusting relationship with the animals and thus get them to work for the nagas."

Female naga lay eggs, but they do not take care of them themselves. Instead, they give them to larger nests for breeding. There, brood helpers take care of the eggs and also of the small nagas when they hatch. Nagas become independent quite quickly and reach the stage of a somewhat six-year-old human child after only one year. Then they are sent back to their parents, who take care of their education - or to one of the parents in case they are no longer in a relationship. Which happens quite often, because nagas rarely form longer, monogamous relationships. Hence, I assume, the displeasure about the intended marriage of Candra and Nihaka, which by many is dismissed as the crazy idea of ​​two teenagers - and with someone from the \"other\" culture at that.\nAnother interesting fact about nagas is, that they sleep either in large, padded round baskets or by curling their snake bodies around thick branches. These very different ways of sleeping can be a source of discussion among naga couples when \"branch sleepers\" meet \"basket sleepers\"."

        "text":"Creatures of Marapur\n\nParder\n\nThe parder is a wild cat inhabiting the jungle-covered isles of Marapur. Its fur is of a dark ochreous ground-color, obliterated by a dark-brown blotted pattern on legs and flanks. A dark stripe also runs from the head across the neck and back. Parders are good climbers, but due to the omnipresence of water they have also developed into good swimmers and like to catch fish. For the nagas, the medium-sized predatory cats hardly pose a threat. They do, however, prey on humanoid bipeds.\n\nMoa\n\nMoas are large birds with striking, colorful plumage that live on the jungle-covered island of Marapur. Because of their strong legs, with which they can move quickly on land, one might think that moas are incapable of flight. In fact, however, they are good flyers and prefer to build their nests in the high mountainous areas of the island. Moas are herbivores and feed mainly on buds, leaves and the fruits of jungle plants. Unusual for birds of this size, many moas have a preference for shiny or glittering objects. If they spot these and can snatch them without major risk, the birds will often steal such items and hide them in their nests. Moa eggs are of an intense red colour, which is why the shells are popularly used by the nagas of Marapur for jewelery and decorations. Both, grind eggs and meat.\n\nTwo-Headed Turtle\n\nThe two-headed turtle has its name for a rather obvious reason: it has two heads. As unusual as this is, the animal is otherwise a common, albeit very large, reptile. It is aquatic and lives mainly in the large reefs around and beneath Marapur. Although it feeds mainly on plants and fish, it can become aggressive and dangerous if you intrude on its territory. The territorial animals do not appreciate visitors. Naga mythology tells, why these turtles have two heads: In the conflict between asuri and naga, they would not choose one side. While the nagas offered wisdom to the turtles, the asuri offered them food. Indecisive and hesitant, the animals turned their heads back and forth between the two parties so often that they ended up with two heads - and neither food nor wisdom.\n\nMakara\n\nMakara are quite unusual amphibious creatures native to the waters of Marapur. They look like a cross between a hippopotamus and a seahorse, but are clearly comparable to the former in size. In earlier times, the makara were often domesticated by the nagas to serve as pack and working animals. However, when the nagas discovered that the giant beavers native to Marapur were easier to tame and less costly to care for and feed, they turned away from domesticating makara. So nowadays, most makara can be found living in the wild. However, they rarely come to the surface, mostly they stay under water, often in already sunken naga ruins.\n\nFoam Stalker\n\nFoam stalkers are elemental water creatures. On Marapur they emerge from the spray of waterfalls cascading down from the mountains. Since they cannot survive on land for long, they quickly retreat below sea level after their emergence and thus populate the reef caves beneath and around Marapur. Because of their elemental bodies, it is often difficult to distinguish them from the water around them. As they roam the reefs, they often  coral branches, flotsam, pearls or small fish with their swirling bodies. These objects can then be seen swirling around in their watery shapes."

I consider myself an expert in glooth machinery and yet I can't figure out how any team in Rathleton could create the designs which where used. Much of the work is attributed to the late professor Larington's team but I knew Larington, and though he was prominent with the city administration he was too much of a traditionalist to harbour such revolutionary ideas. Even more strange is the silence that is met with when you ask former team members about their work with Larington. At best you get some secrecy phrases but it's quite obvious how nervous most of them become when further pressed. Most of them are not as experienced and brilliant as I am anyway. So how could this old geezer and a bunch of dilettantes could create some plant that even I don't remotely understand? And what are they hiding at all? Some officials 'informed' me I should stick to my own business and my tasks at hand. It was suggested that further investigation would do no good to my scientific careerer.

There are some pools or ponds of this glooth in the upper mushroom caves in the east of the tunnels. At the time of my researches these were the only ones, but I fear they are spreading. I assume, it is a kind of mutation that caused the glooth to change this way. I was very careful about my researches as I don't yet know all possible side effects of this mutated glooth variant. What I was able to determine is the following: The mutated glooth is a dangerous thing. It affects its environment in a clearly negative fashion. Some plants wither and rot under its influence, others mutate into toxic, sometimes even animated variants. Smaller cave dwellers as rats, toads and bugs are likewise affected by the side effects of the mutated glooth. They also evolve into poisonous, bigger and stronger variants of themselves. They show an increased aggressiveness and seem to infect other animals with their bite. These first observations lead me to believe that the glooth mutation down here has to be stopped. If it spreads out the danger for Rathleton or even Oramond could be immense."

        "text":"The legend of the flying Venorean has been recounted by generations of seamen. The legend has as many variations as there are ships upon which it is told. Although there are many variations, most of the stories follow a similar theme. In most stories, the ship was built in Venore and sailed under a Venorean flag. The captain is depicted as a daring and able sailor. However, the stories disagree upon whether he was a ruthless man who ruled through fear or a man of honor, respected by his crew. What is certain, is that his ship traded with Thais and Carlin and braved the seas even in the worst weather. It came to pass that the trade barons of Venore forbade all trade with Carlin in order to isolate and weaken the city. They had no problems convincing Thais to join them, as the Thaian authorities viewed Carlin as a renegade province of their Kingdom, and were all too eager to teach them a lesson. The captain of the Flying Venorean, however, disregarded the orders from his superiors. He more or less openly smuggled goods and traded them with Carlin and prospered well in the process. At this point, the legend again becomes vague, with many different versions claiming to be the truth.\n\nSome state that, as the Captain realized that he could get away with defying the authorities, he became arrogant, and began to defy the Gods as well - and duly met with their punishment. Other stories state that in the midst of a raging storm that threatened to cost him his ship, he incurred the wrath of Bashteth by cursing her, and was in turn cursed by her. A further version state that the captain had a love affair with a mermaid who he betrayed, and who then took horrible revenge upon him, as only a woman can. Yet another version cites the reason for the ship's cruel fate was a cursed gift or a piece of cargo given by one of the trade barons as a punishment for the Captain's defiant behaviour. Be that as it may, the ship never returned from its last voyage. Now, this is not an unusual fate for a ship as the sea is a perilous and unforgiving place known to swallow many a ship, but the Flying Venorean did indeed return - as a ghost ship. In the years since she it met with her tragic fate, the Flying Venorean has often been the last thing many a sailor has seen, cresting the waves ahead of a storm that spells doom to those unfortunate enough to encounter it. Only a few have lived to tell the tale, the majority of them broken men with no desire to return to voyaging the seas. As seamen's yarns are like to do, the ship's legend grows with each retelling. Stories differ as to whether they believe the ship's presence of her to be beneficial, a forlorn warning to the doomed ships to baton down the hatches, or whether the ship itself drags its victims into the storm, leading them to a watery grave. Still, there have been too many sightings of the Venorean to altogether disregard this tale as a yarn spun by seamen to scare landlubbers. In some legends, the ship has the allowance to dock and her crew may tread the land for one night only. Such nights are usually marked by fearsome storms and rumors tell of ghostly sailors who hand those they encounter with letters addressed to long dead relatives or who seek out descendants of their family and watch them from afar. Beneath the sounds of the storm, there are some who swear they can hear the sighs and sobs of the seamen bewailing their tragic fate.

        "text":"My travels in the service of the Tibian Explorer Society have led me here, to this island called Oskayaat, south of Chor and Ankrahmun. It is geographically split into two quite different regions. In the west it is covered with jungle, while a steppe extends in the east. A mountain reach in the centre divides the island into the dry east and the humid, overgrown west. Built into those mountains is the beautiful city Oska. In the south-east, on a smaller island, there is a still sometimes active volcano.\nThe people of Oskayaat are quite highly developed. Their civilization is one of art and beauty, well known for its rich culture and history. The Oskayaans are educated and sophisticated and have a strong appreciation for the arts. They have a deep understanding of history, mythology and philosophy, and they respect and value ancient knowledge and traditions. The culture is rich with religious and spiritual beliefs and the people are very religious and pious as well as peaceful and respectful of others.\nOnce the Oskayaans worshipped Suon, the sun god, and Amati, the moon goddess in equal measure. It appears that Amati is a manifestation of Uaris, which is worshipped as a divine aspect of the moon in some areas of the Darama. As their understanding of the world increased, the Oskayaans started to realize that the suns were the source of all life and the moon only reflects their light. Suon became associated with creation, while Amati was associated with the cycle of life. Eventually, the sun became more worshipped than the moon, as it was seen as the more powerful and important force.\nBut then something happened: A curse reached the island, that transformed people into were creatures. Because the animals are were not wolves or bears but tigers, panthers and crocodiles, the people transformed into weretigers, werepanthers and werecrocodiles. The moon kind of took over. Maybe the curse was brought about by some evil force or deity that wanted to cause chaos and destruction on the otherwise peaceful island. Or perhaps it was just bad luck. But the curse spread rapidly, causing madness and mayhem among the people. I myself have been lucky enough to be spared from the curse so far. I have left the town of Oska in panic to escape the wild beasts that the once so civilised and educated people here have become. I must hurry and reach Port Hope before they pick up my scent and tear me to pieces ..."

Some think it is related to the moon goddess. Amati is a gentle and benevolent deity who brings joy and peace to the world. She created the dewberry palm and the foxmouse, her holy plant and animal.\nRecently, Amati was in pain because she had witnessed a volcanic eruption destroying and killing many of her beloved creations. She mourned for the loss of so much life and beauty and her tears fell to the earth. Where they did, the plants changed and became bluish in the moonlight. This signifies that the plants are connected to Amati and her tears and that they can draw power from her presence. It is a sign that Amati is watching over her faithful followers.\nOthers are convinced that the reasons are more sinister. They think the plants are affected by something that is already known in other parts of Tibia as the Curse of the Full Moon. Actually, this phenomenon has so far only affected animals. Humans, when bitten by such cursed animals, turn into ravenous beasts themselves: wolves, bears, foxes, hyaenas ... But on Oskayaat, for the first time, plants also seem to be affected. Some palms, ferns or cacti turn into bluish specimens during the full moon. Worse still, it didn't stop with the plants changing only during the full moon. Recently, they seem to change their appearance every night. Our scholars suspect that, at some point, the consumption of dewberries from affected palms could trigger such a transformation in humans as well. It is therefore to be strongly recommended to all inhabitants of Oskayaat to refrain from eating such blue dewberries."

Yet, I have to ask: is malice at the core of all magic?\nAnd it will remain a question, open to academic dispute. The implications and consequences to be pondered by those that come long after me - at least from my current point of view. As I have dedicated my life to an oath which I once gave, I spent most of my years on this world's soil discovering and destroying artefacts of old, magical contraptions and mystic relics. Never once did I find goodness at the root of such devices, never once was the outcome of dealings with the arcane a boon to any of those involved. I made this decision a long time ago and even before, in times I was but a child, the mere thought of a talisman or charm would make my guts rebel and darken my mind.\nMy life and my travels, the struggles and deprivations led me to a singular conclusion and clear answer to the question I raised. Yet the author of this disquisition will abide and refrain from speculation. I hereby present but the facts and evidence of the effects of magic upon this world and its creatures. According to my studies and personal research and the kind help of the most helpful individuals Spectulus and Sinclair in the Edron academy. My thorough research was also possible thanks to the flourishing enclave of Bounac. Which I was humbled to be invited to stay at by behest of king Kesar himself. A safe haven during several of my expeditions.\n\nContents\nI Magical Weapons - The Ends Justify the Needs\nII Magical Potions - In Wine there is Truth, in Water there is Health\nIII Magical Contraptions - The Biter will be Bitten\nIV Spells - As the Question, so the Answer\nV Artefacts - Classifaction and Organization\nVI Relics - Seek and you shall find\nVII Curses (abridged)\nVIII Appendices\n\nI Magical Weapons (The Ends Justify the Needs)\nBefore we delve into the muck of current state affairs, the politics of war and the valid but ultimately one-dimensional point of it all, we need to look at the basics of magical enchantment and the creation of mighty armament.\n(The book goes on about the various topics, the writing seems driven and determined but neutral and fair for the majority of content.)"

A new species I first described and classified as \"carnisylvan\", an organic mammal, sentient and intelligent but belonging to the realm of beasts. However, as a catastrophic result to arcane influence, Carnisylvans should rather be described as humans, who have undergone a severe but incomplete metamorphosis.\nThey are inherently human and are probably conscious. What little I could gather from the condition, my specimen was in, There was also human tissue and it had distinctive human features such as teeth, fingers and a familiar, if drastically twisted, bone structure.\nAs I continue my studies on what caused this weird condition, I will take the remains to the academy in Edron for further examination."

        "text":"Personal diary of Galthen, The Found Man (Maintained by the royal library of Bounac in gratefulness and kind remembrance of the benevolent knight and scholar Galthen)\n\nI met the most peculiar person on my travels. Visiting Carlin for a bit of rest and recreation during a time of peace, still weary from my travels and a recent quarrel with a broken mage, I found this strange fellow half dead in a shed amidst a few unnerved horses. Completely disturbed, mad from hunger and thirst and with no recollection of his recent past. There was, however, a glint in his eyes. Not from the fires of madness but from hope. The maddening search for something, fueling your anger with raw power to go forward and thrive towards uncertain goals. A state of mind I understand only too well.\nSo I picked the poor fellow up and, with the help of a local healer and simply taking some time to listen, I gave him the opportunity to rest for a bit. Turns out my initial impression was quite accurate, he was indeed looking for something. Or rather... someone. It wasn't clear to me at that time what the definition of the thing was, but I now have to assume he was part of a larger organisation. A secret society, formed for the sole purpose of answering a simple question: what is behind \"everything\".\nHe never spoke about his peers, had no family and absolutely no memory of what happened to him or along his way for at least weeks, monthis even. At night he would suddenly wake up, screaming. Putting everyone else in the resting chambers around him, terrifying them by his calls for mercy, not for him but for lost friends and mentors. I got the feeling he was left completely alone and had to endure a most horrible and unfortunate chain of events that led to his ultimate demise. He then screamed relentlessly for half an hour only to fall asleep again out of pure exhaustion. The whole procedure often repeated itself several times until the morning. After a few days he managed to sleep through. Getting ever more tranquil in the process. When conscious he never answered any questions clearly or even directly. His mind is constantly drifting away, there was not much sense in what he said. Yet some of his ramblings showed a certain method behind his thoughts. He actually tried to keep his mind occupied, distracted from... something. As if the mere thought was more horrifying than everything else. While his subconsciousness could barely keep his mind in check during his sleep, he finally managed to compose himself during the day. This gave evidence not only of a significant intelligence but also a great mind. In a week's time, he gained a state of calm serenity neither me nor a healer could get him out of. He refrained from speaking but a word after that. As if the mere thought was more horrifying than everything else. While his subconsciousness could barely keep his mind in check during his sleep, he finally managed to compose himself during the day. This gave evidence not only of a significant intelligence but also a great mind. In a week's time, he gained a state of calm serenity neither me nor a healer could get him out of.

He refrained from speaking but a word after that.\nAs to why I am mentioning this absurd chance-meeting in these notes I would like to state that this driven individual was far from being a madman. My own research and knowledge in this matter have lead to the conclusion that he is indeed one of the Planegazers. A mere myth, a rumor until now. I came across their legend quite some time ago but it was all speculation and tall tales about hidden riddles of our time. Now I look at them with slightly different eyes for even I cast their ambition away as either completely fictitious or downright insane."

Under the symbol of the snake, the order now raids tombs, temples and crypts dishonorably for artefacts and burial objects. Artefacts are simply sold instead of being destroyed. She will not find a trace of Galthen during this time. Scarlett and her remaining knights decide to occupy an abandoned bastion at the eastern shores of the Darama desert. They operate solely from the shadows from that time on. With the power of the amulet, Scarlett can now see all attacks through obstacles and in any cranny. Her body is now immune against every kind of poison, sickness or decay. Her unnaturally long life makes the cobra order grow constantly. Recruits are found in the underground. Where they whisper of Scarlett and the Cobras in the south. Which plunders and hoards, promising riches and power beyond all imagination. These promises and the legendary power of the Cobra, which is carried on in the murky, sordid Taverns and dark corners of Tibia, provides never ending supplies and new blood.\nIn her desperation, Scarett will never interpret the warning of the cursed amulet. The cursed artifact now ensures that she can see everything except the thing, she carries it deep in her heart. And so Scarlett still looks for Galthen, all-seeing except for the one of whom she yearns so much."

Inside the tomb, next to the sarcophagus of a nameless entity, several burial objects and memorabilia of long forgotten generations, the sculpture of a cobra sits firmly, the amulet draped prominently on top of it. An inscription at the bottom of the sculpture warns: \"The bearer of this amulet will command the gaze, the resilience and deadliness of the cobra. Yet what firmly has its place in the heart of its wearer, the cobra will conceal.\" Taking the amulett, Scarlett is instantly overwhelmed by its grasp and the power it holds within. At this point she is already too weak to destroy it according to her own codex. The dodgy bunch of bandits and assassins she now calls her allies is far from a sworn fellowship. Most of them of dubious morals, full of fear and acting more on their own behalf than that of the group. Thus, noone can muster enough courage to challenge her as she puts on the amulet. The gaze of the cobra allows the wearer to see through the material plane into infinite distance. With the help of this artefact's powers, any attackers, thieves and whoever will stand in her way, shall be easy prey for Scarlett."

When they reached such an artefact, it was destroyed without hesitation. Their resources were always scarce, support from the king was not to be expected anymore. Aquired treasure and burial objects were traded for food and equipment. Two failures in short sequence forced them to pause and stop the undertaking. Resulting disputes between Galthen and Scarlett ended in night long fights without a conclusion. Moral within the whole group rapidly declined. Galthen demanded a departure onto the defensive, remain hidden and focussing on the enemy's weaknesses. Choose only the battles the group can actually handle and let others take care of the rest. Galthen's views were nothing short of treason to Scarlett's ears but she saw wisdom in them. She would never have the heart to banish him from the order and why should she. In the course of a remarkably cold night and after a hefty debate, Galthen disappears without a trace. The order's morals have already sunken so low, that the remaining knights assumed Galthen had resignated in consequence of the ongoing discords. The long, stale period of stagnation lead to resentment and boredom among the nights. Eventually a small group of renegade knights forms to confront Scarlett. When the debate fatally escalates, only a hand full of loyal knights is left to challenge the renegades. One of them loses his life in the process, the others were expelled from the order. Scarlett thanked the loyal men but when she saw their empty eyes, tired and walking outside her tent almost emotionless, she felt more lonely than ever before.\nIn hope of Galthen's return and to boost morale, Scarlett decided to change tactics. The fellowship splits up, goes into hiding. Scarlett now not only looks for artefacts but first of all her supreme commander. The search remains fruitless, however. Years of wasted efforts make her better and reckless. Instead of abandoning this goal, she starts recruiting new and more 'suited' members for her order. A dangerous mix of ragtag bandits, hedge knightsm mercenaries and assassins. Principles and good resolutions start to blur, clear black and white becomes murky grey. Asymmetric partisan tactics and dirty tricks now enter the arsenal of the once righteous order."

After the falling out with the King, the members of Scarlett Etzel's order left their home town Edron to travel south. They went out to look for artefacts in Darama on a quest to destroy evil in all its forms. Searching and destroying black magic and curses flowed into all kinds of relics aeons ago. Under Xenom, Scarlett was known as unrelenting but righteous as well. She helped the order gain recognition and reputation, even in exile. She enjoyed utmost respect and had a good standing among all members of the order. First of all, Galthen, her biggest critic and best tactician all the same. Scarlett's signature tactics of classic warfare, honorable battles and campaigns with flying colors shaped the order in the first time. On her quest, the knights confronted evil ambitiously and virtuously cared for everyone in need. All at the group's expense, however. Scarce rations where shared with the hungry, leaving the fellowship unfit at times. Selfless and heroic actions took a toll on the now dwindling numbers of the order. Scarlett's campaign was also a thankful target for highwaymen, murderers and wild creatures. Galthen was the only one able to challenge Scarlett and often criticized her ways as too dangerous and brash. More often than once she listened to him, but not in this matter. She was determined to lead her group to the great goals she set way back in Edron. After years of campaigns, battles and shared aspiration, Galthen and Scarlett where bonded by more than hirarchy and their functions within the order. Yet neither Galthen nor Scarlett ever confessed their love to each other. Too important the cause, always too short of time. And so he stood up to her for more than half a decade. Despite her hefty attacks against her strategy, she could always rely on him and count on her spirit and expertise."

Anyway, it was basically just an empty chest. Came in from the last expedition. I am sure there was nothing in it when I first laid eyes on it.

It appeared to me that it would probably be a good idea to just place some of the stuff in the empty chest.

Not only against the bite of the glorious cobra, but all kinds of poisons. The potency of this poison is so high, that it can paralyze a grown man within the first 10 seconds of it entering the body. Death will follow in under two minutes, so you will probably kick the proverbial bucket before even regaining the ability to move. Just a hint of the poison in a <this part has been completely redacted> will be enough for <again a redacted part> for a whole garrison of warriors. Even an already sensitized organism will not be able to process more than <again a redacted part> which will result in severe stomach aches and... well, if a whole crew of assassins has to deal with the runs at the same time, you will probably wish yourself away to a different place.

He knew much about magic and always showed great restrain against the seductive aura of power even the most ancient spells emit.

We were assured that the ritual was safe and could serve our purpose most definitely. And indeed we found a portal, an opening to a new continent and a clear sign of the path our honourable order should walk.\nSince we first set foot on these new lands, we felt a sensation of dread. Something out of the order, a tingling on the skin. Like a wind that blows right through you and chills your bones. We explored this island thoroughly to build our fortress on stable ground and in good faith. As our fortifications grew, so did our urge to explore the new continent. Several expeditions were made, one edeavour led to the death of two brothers who died after the bite of strange beasts that roam the barren steppes. When we managed to venture further into the north, we encountered a strange plague, befalling these lands: Ravus, the Grey Plague, as our druid calls it. It affects not only beasts but plants and the very soil.\n\nSoon rumors arose that using the spell to get here was an ill procedure and that we should have omitted the ritual altogether. Some did not see how the page or the book we seek help our cause and that we betrayed chivalric code by conducting a dark rite. This left the Grand Master very furious. There was no further debate ever since. The Grand Chaplain banned any talk about what led us here and Preceptor Lazare stated that he would not have any such nonsense anymore or he calls latrine duty for at least a month.\nThe great quest was proclaimed by Grand Chaplain Gaunder under edict of the Grand Master. We were to find and retrieve the Grimoire Impluviatus, the origin of the single page in our possession. The proclamation included an oath to keep the book safe for no man should use its magic to do evil. As only the Grand Master was deemed able to withstand the power of the book, he was chosen as the Keeper of Grimoire Impluviatus.\nThe plague obviously spread but at an unknown rate. We could immediately sense danger from the plants and animals affected by this disease and stayed away from it as best we could. Eventually our expedition led us to a small temple to the north-east of the continent. The room was decorated with two lizard-like statues in the middle, gazing at each other. Next to a small artificial pond we found the grimoire, Impluviatus. When we returned home, celebrations were in order. The task of the Keeper was assigned to Grand Master Oberon with Grand Canon Dominus as his second.\nYet the feeling of dread that loomed so heavily over the island and the continent did not leave us. What we brought with us was a beacon of evil which we would soon find out. Ravus, the Grey Plague, spread among us. It was first discovered on the graves of the brothers we lost in the steppes. Their resting places were desecrated by a vile dark substance, the stench was almost unbearable. The Grand Canon kept most of us away from the unsightly scene and tried to contain it. None of us knows how many times he shoveled up the graves but it could not be stopped.\nOur druid and the Preceptor are working on a solution to the plague. Our quest is far from over, we pray that there is still hope."

        "text":"Day 1\nIt was a great feast! We were the first guests of the Honorable Falcon Order to arrive. The first time, they invite any delegation to their new outpost. Strangers in a strange new land, it is all so very exciting! We arrived via some form of teleportation, the honorable knights prepared to allow safe passage. The fortress itself is very impressive, more of a bastion really. The great hall filled quickly with countless high-ranking dignitaries from all parts of Tibia. In my role as ambassador and consultant I would never have thought to be invited personally. We stay here for at least another week. Looking forward to meeting the late arrivals before tomorrow's ceremony! When I left our Venore estate, I was sure I'd meet a lot of people - but this is almost overwhelming, really.\n\nDay 2\nThere was some kind of ruckus during ceremony today: someone spilled wine, suddenly everyone started murmuring and then we heard a scream. We immediately got up from the table and I was escorted away. I'm in some kind of tower right now. It looks like they locked me up - for safety they said. Well, if there's anyone I can trust than it's the dignitaries of the Falcon Order. I can't hear a lot of noises out here but when we hastily walked up to this room I heard screams and the sounds of skirmishing. I hope this will be settled soon enough - what is going on?\n\nDay 3\nAt least I have food and drink. I won't get far with this wine and the morsels they seemed to have stored in here but surely someone will come pick me up soon. The loud noises and the skirmishes have stopped several hours ago but nothing else happened. Did they forget about me up here?\n\nDay 4\nNot a single guard. Not a single dignitary, not a soul. They just left me here. When will they ever return? How many days will it take? I doubt the food I found in this chamber will last more than a few weeks. There's only a single window and it's quite small. If I could only find a rope to get out of here. \"Girl, always bring a rope when you leave the house.\", my father said. Every single time I wandered off or strolled outside the estate. See? I listened! But never took it to heart it seems.\n\nDay 5\nFound a nest outside the window, had some eggs in it. I ate one and saved the others for later. How can I get out of here?\n\n(many of the following entries are dealing with killing time and waiting for rescue, some pages have been torn out)\nDay 8\nSomeone walked by outside, no voices. I could only hear footsteps and it was still too early in the morning to see properly. The dense mist you get here in the early hours didn't help as well. Still didn't find a way to fit through the window. It can be opened easily but it's far too narrow for me to fit through. Well give or take another 10 days and I just might...\n\nDay 9\nI threw a bottle with a message out of the window today. Had to sacrifice some of this diary for some quality paper. I still have some wine bottles around here but this was the only bottle I could put a cork in to get it tight enough for a journey over sea. But, alas, somehow it got caught in sea weed or something. I can still see the damn thing right now... I firmly believe my fate is sealed, one way or another.\n\nDay 10 (?)\nWell, I emptied the last bottle of the... red ones. I'm not sure what it was, but I sure can't remember what day it is. At least I got another flask with a cork. Maybe this message will reach someone, it's probably my last chance. No food left for... how long now?\n\nDay 11\nDon't know if I can still see straight, I can't quite make out the second bottle down there so it may have worked... I'm feeling really weak now. For how long...\n\nDay (illegible)\nDefinitely can't see or write properly anymore. Everything feels distant and I can't seem to hear anything from the outside anymore. There's a body here, lying on the ground. I'm not sure if it was there all the time. I couldn't get it... out of the window... I..."

        "text":"The different Orders of the Dark Summoners: Necromancers, Blood Priests and Shadow Masters.\n\nAs it became apparent that the sands of Drefia were an ideal summoning spot and aggregation of Dark Powers, more and more of the brethren of the Dark Cults came and worshiped their Masters. In time, the different beliefs turned out distinct schools of followers, each with their own rituals that specialized and idolized separate aspects of the Dark Powers. The Necromancers were perhaps the earliest of all, soon followed by Priestesses of the Dark Lord, stealthily establishing their rights, rites and temples underneath the sands of Drefia; and in time, quarrels led rival necromancers to found their own groups in which to follow their secret purposes the way they saw fit, and feed - as well as feed on - the dark powers inherent to this place. The Blood Priests worship the fluids of life and death, and above all, blood of course, which they amass in horrendous quantities, as they attribute the most stupefying qualities to this fluid, and experiment extensively with it. This requires a constant supply of fresh bodies, and thus, Blood Priests are avoided even by their fellow Dark Summoners for fear of their life. The Shadow Masters in turn worship the more ephemeral aspect of the Dark Powers, and are extremely secretive to the point of never being seen. Only the Shadow Pupils, their apprentices, mingle with other students of the Dark Arts, and it is rumored by the other schools that they use the shadows of things and beings as a means of travel and transport, and can summon lesser spirits and demons forth from any shadow. This may or may not be exaggerated, but the Shadow School is unmistakeably a very mysterious order with secrets they never share outside their own ranks, and the little we know can only be gathered from their altars at the Dark Sites, where the Shadow Pupils seem to study the aspects of light and shadow , and are often seen pouring over strange inscriptions, and gathering ashes. As far as the author of this book is aware, Necromancers study the flow of life and undeath in all its forms, trying to control life in death and death in life, and ever finding new means of prolonging or shortening one or the other, without being squeamish about their means to do so. In their eyes, life and death are not necessarily mutually exclusive ways of existing - at least as far as concerns their study subjects. The Dark Priestesses seem to have a working relationship with the traditional school of necromancy, if indeed there is one, and specialize in mystic dances and chants that imbue objects and beings with the might of the Dark Powers, channeling the dark magical energies of this place . It is whispered they can hypnotise, drug and control other beings; but it is certain they make splendid salves, ointments, powders and concoctions, and on their wisdom of herbs the other schools draw upon. However, the Dark Priestesses charge heavy fees for their services, and not to pay them to their fullest satisfaction is said to be a sure way of incurring their wrath - which means a slow, painful death. channeling the dark magical energies of this place.

The Miunir were the once who copied and 'translated' many of the Shapers' texts and stored them in their vast libraries. Since the Miunir treasured knowledge above everything else, they refused to share their knowledge even with their closest friends. When the orcs overrun the Miunir enclaves, most of the knowledge was destroyed and lost forever. Luckily, some of the Miunir's works about the Shapers survived. However, the forbidden treasures of knowledge the Miunir had collected was met with much more interest than the remaining Shapers knowledge. Only recently interest in the Astral Shapers knowledge was revived. Even though the works of the Miunir are often seen as part of the so-called Shaper records, the records themselves are much more important and full of vital information. After being translated, copied and rewritten numerous times, some of these texts, however, are now nearly worthless. The most adequate texts are those written in ancient Miunir. However, since many self-absorbed scientists found it fancy to show off by writing their own works in Miunir, texts written in this ancient language are no longer a guarantee for quality."

        "text":"Telia and Tigo I\n\n(This book is written in elven language. Contrary to the old elven legends, this seems to have been written less than a decade ago. It contains a tragic tale of two individuals who rejected their heritage and disappeared from the world. Surprisingly, almost all the pages contain a handwritten translation as if to make readers ignore the elven roots of the tale.)\n\nrejection\n\nTigo was always an industrious elf. He helped his kin where ever he could, started his day early and ended it late. Despite his efforts to help his community, he was not a person you'd actually notice much or sometimes at all. He preferred to stay in the background, kept to himself most of the time. Yet this was not to escape the other but to shield himself. Rejection was his one true fear of him, a nemesis that plagued him since he remembered. And his father of him, before him. His time as a happy child within the confines of a loving family was short lived. When his father lost his wife, he spent the following years concentrated on his only son. There were times when Tigo felt the warmth of his father's loving care for him but there were far more occasions where he experienced the meaning of being left alone. He saw the decline of the only parent he directly knew, felt the heat of his rage in times of dispair and the grief in times of solitude. He never wanted to end like this. The decision to stay away from others, to eliminate social interaction as much as possible was quickly made. Even as a youth, he was an outsider of some proportion-but he still wanted to be a valuable member of his community. Unlike his father, who as Tigo reached adulthood, he ultimately left, not to be seen ever again.\n\nsolitude\n\nTigo would not draw attention to him, work for himself most of the time but help the others and provide support any time he could. As long as they left him alone afterwards, leave him to enjoy the peace and quiet of his life as a loner.\n\nshelter\n\nIt didn't help when a villager from a far away town, an outsider himself, came to him. He simply appeared at his doorstep, in the middle of the night. A human, incapable of speech, wounded and alone. Desperate. Desperation was something Tigo was used to since he could count. He took the poor soul in, despite his aversion to having another person so close to him. Especially here, in his own habitat. But what harm could he do, he was in no condition to get on his nerves and didn't say a word. Just a few days passed, the man got better, started eating more, looked outside the windows, started walking around. Indeed his interest towards what happened outside grew with every day, yet he did not make any move to just get up and leave. He just stayed, cowering in one corner of Tigo's house, always focused on the windows. Tigo used a system of gestures to find out if he needed anything or to give him basic directions. It worked somehow and after a few more days, it was good to go. Tigo was not very versed in contact with others, let alone humans. But he saw that his protegé from him got increasingly tense. With every day he grew more nervous, clutching to the windowsill, even checking under his bed.\n\nExit civilization\n\nThe smash. Broken glass and howling wind. He woke up to a room full of people. At least six persons stood around his bed, watching. He jumped up in his sheets and looked at the gathering wide-eyed and in cold sweat. This was something he simply wasn't prepared for. Nor could he ever have. He was not used to that many people and now half a dozen are standing in his very own bedchamber. He got a bit angry and threw the most threatening stare he could manage to form in the general direction of one of the intruders. Then he saw their weapons."

While he isolated himself, ignoring most of the talk of the others, even everyday life with all the ups and downs he did not hear from the sinister individual who entered one of their peaceful homes for him one night. The man who simply came and murdered one of their own. The man who took a precious life from this community. The man he gave shelter to. When he realized that he fostered and nurtured what the others perceived as a monster, it was already too late. He never found out if the human he took in was confused or deranged - it's clear that he didn't intend to do what he did - or was it? If the others could only see, understand that he was trying to help... no, the odds where clearly against him. It was him, lonely and secluded, a mystery himself - against all the others, together. With their normal lives, their homes, their families. Now he was truly alone. The guards who arrested him took good care, they didn't even throw him in a cell but him in the guard house. They let him live, choose. For all the good he did to the community, for all the help he provided. If not for that unforgivable last time. He knew what he had to do and would not hesitate to make it so. Maybe he already made this decision a long time ago. As his father did. He chose to forget all this, to leave. He chose exile, the very definition of rejection. They let him live, choose. For all the good he did to the community, for all the help he provided. If not for that unforgivable last time. He knew what he had to do and he would not hesitate to make it so. Maybe he already made this decision a long time ago. As his father did. He chose to forget all this, to leave.

He chose exile, the very definition of rejection.\n\nRefuge\n\nWhen he first encountered the Barkless, it was their leader himself, Leiden, who took him in. A strong, firm and glorious leader with a vision. He was promised a life of peace, recreation, even appreciation. It would not have been this life, it was already too late for that, but another, a better one. He willingly absorbed all he could from this wondrous leader. An elf himself, outcast and broken but determined to change his fate. Tigo liked that. Very much. And he showed it by helping this small community in all the ways he could. As he always did. Even back when... but that life was over now. He gladly accepted this life of hardship, pain and suffering. He was Barkless, one of them. He would be true in the end, he would get his redemption from him if he only worked for it.\n\nTelia\n\nA new member was introduced, that probably marked the first and only time another person deeply piqued his interest. Telia was a strong woman, she chose this life among the Barkless by herself, her reasons forever a secret. Time passed and she endured the pain and deprivations like no other. At least in his eyes her. She must have traveled far to reach the Barkless, she looked different from other elves. Even exotic in a way but an elf nonetheless. But what would he know, the few woman he laid eyes upon during his life where she either already taken or would not be interested in someone like him. And how would this even work? This life he once led, his life him ... with a woman? But this, new life - this could be different. She would understand. And somehow she did. However, the reader must understand that a real relationship is strictly forbidden amongst the Barkless. A problem in the truest sense of the word. They had to get creative. A look here, a gesture there, a kiss. Just quickly, quietly. No one other shall know..."

He locked himself up in his chambers most of the time and did not let anyone near him. When Tigo became a Beacon of the Barkless, the \"Trial\" was already established. A new rule and sacrifice every Barkless now must bring upon him or herself. Some didn't make it, even went insane as they did not bring themselves to finish it. That would not happen to Tigo... and most importantly, not to Telia.\n\nThe Trial and Leiden's Recommendation\n\nWhen the trial came, Tigo was ready but alas, he would be the first not to undertake it. Leiden called him his \"first\" Beacon and that he already proved true. He would not attend nor should he ever. Now it was Telia who needed to conduct the rite. A recommendation from Leiden himself favored her explicitly. She should be next, circumventing the rules of regular ascension. Tigo did not wonder then, he rarely did. Wasn't it great that she was favored? And he would stand watch while she did and both would fulfill their duties as best they could. As she went in, she showed no fear.\n\nRetaliation and the death of Telia\n\nTelia did not return. The chamber of purification, highest honor and apex of the trials proved to be her grave. At first Tigo did not understand. But then he saw that they hadn't been true anymore. Their love and time of happiness, as short and full of deprivation as it was, was not theirs to have. As the Barkless suffer in this life, they rejoice in the next. But Leiden knew, he wanted them to see, to feel this. He must have known that the purification would not work as long as our bond existed. The Leiden he once knew, however, would have guided them. He would have told them. He saved them. But he chose to deepen the suffering. This is not what this should be about. Whatever influence corrupted Leiden, Tigo swore to bring an end to it.\n\nAnd there he stood, waiting. Beacon of the Barkless, as was his duty to this community. And he helped his community all he could."

From what I could make out, I'm to be sacrificed to some kind of god that the orcs are worshiping. I learned little about that god but it seems to be an incredibly bloodthirsty one, even by orcish standards. I've seen the orcs driving themselves into some berserk frenzy with singing, dancing and drinking a strange brew that their shaman is giving them. This shaman is the driving force behind this tribe. He is the voice of their god and promised them blood and plunder beyond compare. From what I could find out, he promised his followers a new age of blood in which they would flourish and rule due to the blood of the god. I'm sure he is referring to the brew that he makes them drink regularly. Whatever it is, it actually changes these orcs. In the few days I've been held captive, I've seen several individual orcs growing visibly in size and strength. I've also witnessed fits of rage. On several occasions, an orc killed one of his peers in an uncontrollable outburst. I've also noticed the arrival of a sizeable shipment of quality weapons and armor. It seems they have a supplier and ally with remarkable resources. He is probably linked to the shady figure that arrived here, a stormy night two days ago. He was wearing a dark hooded cloak, but had humanoid features at least. He was too slender to be an orc, almost as slim as an elf. He conversed with the shaman in private. Even with my inevitable death at hand, I can't help to wonder what they are up to. For sure, some well-equipped berserker orcs are a threat to the area but I doubt I will be able to share this information with my superiors in the TBI What I know is, that I don't plan to die as a sacrifice to their god. I will try to escape my prison even if there is little chance I will make it out of the camp. I will hide these notes in the feint hope that someone might find them someday, though it's obvious this would probably mean he had become a prisoner, too."

A leader who deserves this title and who is ready to restore our greatness once again. Wisdom, determination and new, powerful weapons are his tools to shape the fate of the minotaur race. A new order will arise and the old one will be cast down. The rigid structures that have prevented the young and talented from rising will be destroyed. A new system rewarding skill but also loyalty will be put in place. The race will be united under a new ruler and use all its strength and power towards one goal only: the restoration of minotaur power. But we won't stop there, brothers and sisters. We will forge a new empire of minotaurhood, the likes of which the world has never seen. We will subjugate the other races and put them into the place they belong to. Those who oppose us, though, will be vanquished. A true minotaur will join us in our just cause. Coward traitors, though, who cling to the old ways that led to our downfall, will be crushed underneath the heels of our marching legions. The world will be fully ours. We are destined to rule. The lesser races will bow down or be obliterated. No longer will we hide beneath the surface but rather walk upon it as rightful rulers. We will walk the green pastures once again and our herds will flourish and multiply. Our rule will be absolute and those who have joined our cause will be rewarded accordingly. Those who cowardly hide and wait for the inevitable new order might be allowed to live after we have passed judgment on them. Yet, those who join early and further our goals will become the new lords in the world that we are about to create. Our leader will rule supreme with the godlike powers he acquired and he will grant a fraction of them to those who are worthy. Don't hold back. This is the time to act. Be brave and earn your place in the new order now. Hesitate, and you will doom yourself and your descendants to unimportance for eternity. We are about to bring much needed order and dignity to our realm. You are either with us or against us. Don't be blind to the change that is to come.

Just take a look around if nobody answers. Because I may just as well be dead already. I do not know why Marv has left me a piece of paper and a quill, that bastard. When we landed on this island, there were barely 20 of us. Marv as our captain ordered us to scout the place. It didn't go well. Not far from our landing point we spotted creatures with bigger teeth than our heads and large feet. Without any eyes they just smelled us. They attacked as soon as we laid eyes on them. A dozen other sailors died on the first day, like flies. We were about to retreat, go back home, get backup - but Marv kept on pushing. He ordered us... <illegible part> commanded us to breach that large wall. That wretched wall. He wanted to get deeper into the island. He wanted us to make it fall.\nI always suspected he found something, he knew something. He was hiding something from us and now I know. He showed me, and then he left me here to rot. Never to spill his secret from him. There's just enough ink left to... <the next part is unreadable> So I will just write about what may be most important to you. There are creatures on this island which are so wretched and evil that they carry death themselves. And somehow he managed to hunt one down or maybe it has surrendered to him willingly. Whatever the case, he got his hands on something nobody should ever have.\nBut I need to tell the whole story to make whoever reads this understand. In some gods-forsaken harbor, Marv came by a broken ring. He won a gamble and the other guy didn't want to pay. He talked about how he found this in another dimension or something. About how it was an extremely mighty ring but that broke and that a creature was carrying it. Whatever fantasies that man had, Marv killed him and all he got was that stupid piece of metal. This tainted place was a perfect match for our captain, I can tell.\n\n<there seems to be another page which continues the scribblings>"

Whatever Marv did to wrestle this... thing from the abominations on this island, he would never be the same again. It was a simple string of a dark shade, not very large and unnaturally smooth. It looked like it was a shiny piece of metal, yet did not seem to reflect a thing, not even Fafna and Suon's healing gauze. When he pick up that piece of rope it suddenly got a life of its own. It wrapped itself around his arm, while he was still wearing that cursed ring. At first he was shocked but that feeling lifted soon, as he began to fantasize about strength, speed and power. He babbled about seeing things and hearing unspeakable sounds. I do not know if it was still our captain or just something else. Then he seemed to struggle in pain, he screamed and winded himself. We did not dare approach him. After some time he seemed to stop doing anything at all, no more moving, no more talking, not even a single breath. And then he just got up. He removed some dust from his coat and walked away, with a laugh on his lips and a pat on my shoulder.\n\nI am sure it is connected to the ring as he showed me the piece of string briefly afterwards. It did nothing at all to me and I was quick to return it, not wanting to have anything to do with that for it surely meant bad fortune for us all. And it did. Maybe even touching it was my demise. I do not know, nor do I care anymore. All I have to do now is to warn anyone else walks the blood-soaked soils of this isle. The ring turned him into something far more treacherous than what we saw up until this point it seems. When we found out he does not intend to leave this island, the others raised a mutiny. I remained petrified by fear of his reaction from him, as I was one of the few who witnessed first hand what that ring had done to him. And I knew that no good would come of it anyway.\n\nIn the end he killed every soul opposing him. Except for me.\n\nNow here I lie. For he did only destroy my body and chained me to the very walls of this cave. He gave me quill and paper. Why? Maybe to write all of this down.\n\nHan, former First Mate of the SS Primordia\n\nPS.: I have some ink left and I have to say I am unsure of why he wants me to write this. I guess it's days since I saw daylight, only the small glimpse reaching into this cave from far above. If feels as my life is fading. But why did he made me write this down? As a warning? Probably not. Maybe he wanted to torture me <illegible> and he gave me barely enough ink to write it all down, why? <an unfinished sentence and then an abrupt fullstop> Maybe he wanted me to - now I know w... <illegible, the quill seems to run dry> THERE ARE OTHER RINGS! HE WANTS YOU TO- <the next letters were written without ink and by too weak a hand to recognize them>"

But we found beautiful treasure first! But couldn't decide yet, who will take what. So Ra'Clette had a great idea: We sealed treasure away! How? Listen: Treasure Chest is behind spooky gate. Looks like big skull with maw wide open. Ra'Clette powerful witch, she knew that skull gate is a magical portal. And she knew how to seal it with a spell. So we did this: We all thought of nice little rhyme and used it as secret password for portal. But to make sure that none of us goes there alone and gets treasure, Ra'Clette had genius plan: Rhyme has four lines, and each one of us noted one. Then Ra'Clette cast spell that makes us forget rhyme completely. So each of us has left only line on our piece of paper. Now, each of us only knows one line, so we must return all to open skull gate. One day we will and get treasure, as soon as we know how to share. Only problem is, I don't want to keep written note. Not safe, someone could steal. But I don't have such a great memory, I'm afraid I will forget my line. Perhaps I will teach it to my parrot Larry, who knows. This is it for now, dear parents.

I will head to the nearby mountains to look for a hiding place there.\nThe gods are with me! Not only did I find some sort of cave, but also a fourth raid covered my disappearance from the town. Now I have to manage to live here for a few years in a hideout, then I might return to the town. I have yet to explore the caves fully. They seem quite huge and I can only hope that I am not running out of luck. I do not want to imagine what would happen to me if I run into some hostile inhabitants here. Still I think my skills are sufficient to handle some cave bears or even some tarantulas. If I run into a giant spider, I might have a problem though. My supply of runes is not large enough that I could spend them needlessly."

The first humans who encountered the dragon most likely were devoured. It took some time until the word about the dragon was spread by those who eventually managed to escape. Soon heroes flocked to the cave to challenge and slay the beast. The heroes from the morning of the awakening world were only accustomed to monsters like orcs and the occasional cyclopes. For this reason, they considered themselves as invincible. Little did they know about the power of a dragon.\n\nWhen the first of the greatest heroes perished, the world held its breath in shock. More heroes were sent, this times in groups. This time they used the fledgling art of magic, but to no avail. One by one and group by group, the heroes fell. The hoard and the fame of the dragon grew. Then by chance a cunning hero learned that the dragon was allergic to certain flowers. Strategies were devised to use this weakness against it. However, this weakness only ensured that some of the would-be-dragonslayers managed to escape. And although the rediscovered knowledge about magic increased and was successfully used against dragons that appeared elsewhere, the first dragon managed to elude this fate. One day the king decided that action had to be taken against the vile beast in the vicinity of his beloved city. So he gathered an army of heroes from all over the realm to confront and finally slay the dragon. A formidable army was established that marched towards the dragon's lair. Armed to the teeth with weapons, ammunition and runes and their hearts filled with dedication and bravery, they stormed the lair at noon. But the first dragon was gone! All they found was a common dragon, no stronger than the ones they had slain before. In their fury the dragon hunters killed the beast. However, neither fame nor fortune could be gained on that fateful day. All they found was a common dragon, no stronger than the ones they had slain before.

Some believe that this is just a myth or an allegory, however, those who already lived back then attested that the tales were true. Optimistic voices claim that the dragon knew about the approaching heroes and fled the realm of men for good. Others suggest that the first dragon just grew old and flew to the dragon cemetery to die there. Others again fear that the dragon retreated into some remote corner of the world. There it is growing and gaining strength in order to return one day. Then it will challenge all humans and force them to their knees once more."

They were of no value concerning information about their secret society.\nNonetheless two of them were given to the torturers.\nAs expected nothing useful could be learned, even though the vampiric regeneration could once again be observed.\nGiven the need for information on how to torture the creatures effectively, should a more valuable specimen fall into our hands, several new techniques were tried out. Most proved to be unsuccessful. Eventually both probands died at intended points of the experiment.\nThe other four were subjected to a series of experiments in order to learn more about the nature of the beasts.\nAs expected sunlight had an effect on the creatures though not as severe and effective as one might wish.\nThe vampires showed an incredible fear and aversion to it. Sure enough the tested specimens began to show an actual reaction to the sunlight. Sadly the reaction started off quite slow and later than expected. It took about half a minute before the vampires' skin turned reddish and began to peal off. Another half a minute later their bodies began to smoke, parts of the skin turning to ash. The process continued for another minute before they completely turned to dust.\nOne specimen was lost in that experiment. The others were salvaged in different states of sunburn and began to regenerate.\nAs with other tests it could be observed that the vampires have the ability of regeneration but not of regrowth.\nThe regeneration of those worst wounded took significantly longer than that of the lesser wounded. Adding blood improves the regeneration process considerably.\nIt is to be assumed that human blood would have had additional effects.\nThe worst burnt vampire took two weeks to regenerate, needing a considerable amount of blood.\nThe vampiric body proved highly resistant to cuts and slashes inflicted by magic weapons. Silver lowered that resistance considerably.\nFire and acid proved to be quite effective, contrary to this all administered poisons did not have any discernible effect.\nStakes made of various materials were tested. While some merely immobilized the creatures, blessed stakes eventually turned them into dust.\nTheir strengths and senses were also evaluated. Even the young vampires were extremely strong, matching the strength of three or four grown men.\nThey were all able to see in the dark. At least half of them seemed to have increased hearing capabilities. None of them, neither well fed nor under the threat of death could turn into a bat or a wolf.\nIn conclusion we can assume that the traditional means at our disposal are sufficient to eliminate any vampires we might encounter. To ensure that they will not rise again, the use of a blessed stake is mandatory.\nWe have to assume that the abilities and reactions of older vampires differ, either being increased or reduced."

After chasing leads from the local underworld, we managed to follow certain individuals to a secret meeting spot. Since we could not successfully infiltrate the secret society and lost two good men in the process, we decided to solve the matter with brute force. We stocked up the ranks of the city guard with several soldiers. We were confident not to meet any significant resistance due to our authority and sheer numbers. That proved to be fatally wrong for several of our men, though. Through investigation, we had deduced a good time for a decisive strike that would catch the cult in the midst of one of its meetings. Shortly before midnight, we breached the doors of their hideout in the wilds. Two armed guardians in robes fell swiftly. We immediately proceeded deeper into the lair, following the sounds of chanted incantations. That was when things began to go wrong. Some of the men in the vanguard began to stumble and became slower. We still pressed forward eagerly, discounting the irritation to the thick, aromatic fumes that ascended the tunnel from the gathering hall. When we reached the main room, our eyes were full of tears from the heavy smoke. The cultists seemed unaffected. When I loudly announced to them who we were and that they were under arrest, silence dropped. I was sure they would surrender now but suddenly, there was this scream. I don't know who screamed first but a heartbeat later others joined. The whole cavern vibrated from the insane screaming and I saw some of my men dropping their weapons to cover their ears. Then the cultists threw themselves against us in a single screaming mass of hands and daggers. They disregarded sanity and safety; the first wave impaled themselves on the weapons of the soldiers. But that did not even stop them. In hindsight, I'd say they weren't undead or something like that. They just seemed to refuse to die. Driven by insanity and rage, soldiers who knew their trade were killed with bare hands in horrific manners. Some lost their nerves and fled. Yet, others seemed to succumb to a madness that rivaled that of the cultists and started stabbing friend and enemy alike. As I managed to re-establish formation, things got gradually better and in the end, we gained the upper hand. Yet, all cultists lay dead and many of my men had been killed and not even one was without an injury. Later, we examined the corpses and several cultists were identified as local traders and craftsmen. None of them had been suspicious or had any criminal background. After searching their lair, we found evidence that it had been a rather newly established cult. How they had managed to induce so much fanaticism is a riddle to me. Disturbingly, some of the rooms had been built to house something HUGE. It was clear that those were rather living rooms or cells than storage rooms. What all this means, I only can wonder. some of the rooms had been built to house something HUGE. It was clear that those were rather living rooms or cells than storage rooms.

No beast was too fierce, no demon too intimidating for Ilos to avoid them. He became a living legend and paragon of all that was considered knightly. In one of his adventures he and his friends cleansed a crypt of a long extinct race from its evil. The deeper they went, the more unnatural and twisted their enemies became. Level after level was cleansed by the fighters and priests yet the catacombs seemed to stretch on an on into the darkest depths of the world. The deeper they went, the more the rune-engraved walls began to shift and whisper as if they had a live on their own. One by one, the party became separated and lost. Only for Ilos the way seemed to open as if something or someone was guiding him to a special place deep within. Determined but confused by constant whispers in unknown languages Ilos continued. It did not even occur to him that he was all on his own by that point. So strong was his urge to move on, to face and overcome the darkness that had taken refuge there. After a journey that might have lasted hours or days he arrived at a huge chamber whose geometry mocked the laws of nature. It was barren but for a single colossal throne in its centre. On this throne of greyish stone sat a regal but horrible figure of nonhuman origin. The mummified thing had multiple arms and an elongated skull with shark-like teeth. When Ilos approached it, he felt that this had to be the source of the catacomb's evil. His sword drawn he stepped closer. And the thing arose. Then it was all dust and blades. A fight of epic proportions erupted. The unnatural entities seemed to have all advantages on its side yet Ilos was determined and had faced other evils before. In the end the exhausted Ilos stood over the broken body of his enemy. In the heap of dust and bones Ilos spotted an amulet that he hadn't noticed before. The gleaming jewel emanated power and as the victor, Ilos claimed it for his own. The catacombs seemingly had lost their magic and though he was unable to find any of his lost companions, Ilos returned to the light of the suns. From this day on Ilos and the amulet became inseparable. He never ever parted with it, even when sorcerers in his circle of friends requested to examine it. He still travelled the land and fought in many valiant quests. But less and less he consorted with other people and he became a loner. With worry his distanced friends saw Ilos staring at the jewel or even sometimes whispering to it. At some point a couple of his friends decided they had to get rid of the amulet to free their friend from its seeming influence. When Ilos was asleep three former companions snuck into his dark room and with the help of some sorcery managed to take the amulet from him. In that moment the amulet bursted into a glowing light and burned the hand of its thief to ashes. Ilos now wide awake swiftly slew the intruders, not even bothering who they were. In a hurry and convinced that he had to protect his amulet he fled the castle where they resided. In the years to come Ilos no longer went on quests. When he was sighted it usually lead to bloodshed by his hand for he had become a bitter and easy to anger man that seemingly was looking for trouble. Eventually he gathered a band of bandits and outcasts from various races and begun plundering the lands. always on the move as if looking for something. The cruelty of his campaign mocked all that was once dear and valuable to him. Eventually his horde was cornered by a superior force and utterly crushed. In the aftermath of the battle Ilos' body was recovered. The mysterious amulet though, was nowhere to be found."

        "text":"The family line of the Antarel family was tainted with orcish blood since generations. A shameful secret hidden from the public. Though thought to have thinned out enough to no longer pose a threat, this assumption was disproven by the birth of Marik. Born with obviously orcish features he was hidden away and declared a miscarriage. While he was raised by an elderly couple in service of the baron as their own, three years later a brother, Gisbar, was born by the barons wife, who was declared the official heir. The baron, perhaps out of a feeling of guilt, chose young Marik to be raised as one of his squires. Marik proved extremely skilled in the art of battle. Growing almost disturbingly fast in size and strength, with 14 years he could go toe to toe with the best of the barons knights. Yet due to his heritage knighthood remained beyond his grasp. After the baron died by a riding accident when Marik was 17 years old, he became the squire of his younger brother, without either of them knowing about their relationship. Albeit Marik was known for his fits of rage and shunned by others for his brutish looks, the two became good friends and were nigh inseparable. While Marik fell in love to the fair maid Marisha it was his brother who would court and marry her in the end. When Gisbar officially became the baron, he ignored the traditions and knighted his friend and squire. This didn't suit the other knights and nobles well and what has been hidden mockery in the past became open provocation of Marik. The hot headed Marik duelled three of the nobles, maiming them badly, until baron Gisbar had to order him to stop this behaviour. Not much later though, the anger over insults overwhelmed Marik again, and this time he slew his opponent without any declaration of a duel. Gisbar had to judge over this case and in an effort to save his friend and former squire, he settled to banish Marik from the realm. Marik lived a while as a mercenary in foreign lands, always longing for the place he once called home. When he learned that his 'father' was in his death bed and Gisbar and Marisha were expecting their first child, he decided to return home in disguise. His dying father confessed to Marik the circumstances of his birth and heritage. Marik was devastated on many levels. Without any idea how to react or what to do, he attended the feast for the barons new-born in disguise. Wine and beer were served freely and like everyone else in the feast ccc became drunk. When the jesters and musicians entertained the crowd, one particular ugly and disfigured jester caught the attention of the equally drunk Marisha. She pointed at the poor creature and yelled that he almost looked as ugly as that oaf Marik. The whole drunken crowd joined her in laughter. This was when Marik drew his weapon. With fury and madness he slaughtered not only his brother and his wife but the whole entourage. With the help of his mercenary comrades he held the barony for a few months, even petitioning the king with his plight. In the end though an army was sent to bring him to justice. Before they arrived, ccc took his own life and the mercenaries took him with them to give him a proper burial."

        "text":"Sir Necaran was a scientist first and a knight only second. He has always been fascinated by animals like snakes, spiders and even the fabled basilisks. So over the course of his studies he became a master of poisons. He developed the philosophy that only the weak would succumb to the power of the poison while the strong would not only survive but eventually become stronger by the ordeal. To overcome weakness one had to overcome the various poisons. Therefore he applied all kinds of poisons to himself, to become immune to them over the cause of time. Several of the poisons though induced hallucinations and emotional instabilities. Some of the poisons even had an addictive potential. Oblivious to such dangers Sir Necaran continued his Quest. He acquired the poisons of some of the most deadly beasts of the known world and despite setbacks he seemingly overcame them all. He even begun to see the hallucinations as divine signs that he tried to interpret in his feverish mind. More and more he turned to the poisons that granted him the most intense vision. In one of these poison induced trips, however, he went on a rampage. Seeing demonic monsters everywhere, he slew several of his unsuspecting friends on a minor slight. After the poisons effect waned away he recognized in horror what he had done. He fled civilisation to live in the remote wilderness. But the longing for more visions and stronger poisons endured. With a makeshift laboratory he begun to extract poisons again. Ultimately little of the man that he once had been remained and he completely succumbed to his addiction. The forest that he lived in became feared for the mad man that haunted it. No sane person travelled there anymore without dire need and in the villages around the forest wanderers were warned and children were scared with the man of the forest. Now and then a lost wanderer made his way into the forest. It's said that it was as likely to be met with hospitality and aid as to meet ones end at the hands of a ravening berserker. Over time the person of Sir Necaran slipped into obscurity and only the legend remained. After several years though members of Necarans former order searched the woods, not even sure what they were expecting to find or certain how to handle this situation. They only to find his corpse in a cave that he seemingly had called home for the last years. It is said the body was in a bad shape and the knights were unable or unwilling to learn the cause of his death. It was brought home for a proper funeral."

        "text":"The red knight was born into the ancient noble house of Gorlar. Though never numerous, the Gorlar were always in a position of privilege and power. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world though, house Gorlar was still ruled by its founder Count Boras Gorlar, who was a powerful vampire. Under his iron rule the mortal Gorlars made their political moves and decisions. The mortals of the family were his mere puppets, allowed to live and serve as he deemed it fit. Now and then he would 'cull' the herd of his family by claiming the life and blood of a descendant he was as unfit or just useless for his plans. He kept the number of the family members small to better keep them in check. Generations of Gorlars provided him with victims amongst their serfs. Although Boras sometimes promised to raise a worthy descendant as a vampire, he never felt like allowing anyone else this amount of power. The red knight was like other of his family shrewd and ambitious. But his skill and cunning impressed even the old Boras. The red knight not only fulfilled the requests of his ancestor, he often improved the plans on his own and met even more spectacular success than expected. Though Boras tried to tempt the red knight with promises of immortality the latter was well aware that this would never come to pass. So he secretly sent his spies to find him another vampire, to acquire the vampire power on his own. What he found, however, was an old alchemist who was well versed in the lore of vampires. With his potions, ointments and toxins he planned a coup to overthrow and  his ancestor. On the longest day of the year, when vampires are at their weakest, he and his men overpowered the vampire and bound him in chains. With exotic ingredients, the blood of the ancient vampire and the blood of many innocent victims they distilled an elixir that would grant them longlivety. Over the decades the need for more and more frequent applications of the elixir became necessary and more and more people lost their lives over this unholy quest. In the end the alchemist succumbed to old age and the red knight became more desperate. In a finally gambit he drained Boras of all of his blood and tried to become a vampire on his own by dark and unholy rites. The rites failed him though and with the last source of the elixir gone he shrivelled and aged within an hour after the new dawn."

They consist of people who feared for their influence and wealth they had accumulated in the past by exploiting their power and the flawed regency system.

Madmen who feared that the wisdom of the dragon kings would pierce the webs of deceit they had woven over the minds of their lizard brethren over centuries.

They gained little support at all, and so they tried the unthinkable, to poison and to assassinate the dragon kings in one single night.

        "text":"So it came to pass that the elder gods created Banor the Divine Warrior. He was the very first human, and though his creators gave him powers no other member of his race would ever be able to match, he already displayed many characteristics clearly which proved him to be human. To this very day he is especially revered as an ideal of chivalry and bravery by those who dedicate themselves to the art of hand-to-hand combat, for he was just and brave in battle, and his prowess of him with the blade is legendary to this very day. Legend has it that the gods were also planning to create a twin brother for Banor, and that this twin was to wield incredible magical powers. However, it is said that Zathroth stole this prototype to create from it the very first demon overlord. Whatever the truth, the fact that the humans had entered the world of Tibia could no longer be overlooked. For despite their many weaknesses they were a brave and clever race, and they adapted surprisingly well to the grim world into which the gods had cast them. They took up the fight against the undead and the various others despicable creatures that roamed the lands, and soon the hordes realized that a new, powerful enemy had arisen.Many a fierce and bloody battle was fought, but Banor, a brave and shrewd leader , led his people from victory to victory. Still, those triumphs were often paid for with heavy sacrifices, and the sheer numbers of enemies the humans had to face was overwhelming. The gods did all they could to assist their new champion race in its struggle. Uman introduced the race into the arcane art of magic, and many a human followed his vocation to become a powerful sorcerer. Others were instructed by Crunor the Lord of the Trees to learn about the secrets of life, and they became druids and learned how to heal those of their brethren who were wounded in the war against the relentless enemy. Of all humans it was them who learned most about the secrets of life, and in fact some of them assisted Crunor in creating many creatures that populate Tibia today. But many of their creations were soon enough wiped out in the course of the cruel struggle. And the war went on and on. Banor had established a strong foothold in the land, and he consolidated his rule of his by founding a dynasty. He married Kirana, the noblest of all women, and she bore him Elane, who eventually came to master both the arts of distance fighting and the arcane art of magic, thus becoming the very first of the noble paladins. To this day the position of the leader of all paladins must only be filled with a woman, and those who do so invariably adopt the honorary name of Elane. Later on Elane fought side by side with her father, because Banor, who was in fact a demigod, was to live for many centuries. But even this did not help to turn the tide. The human warriors triumphed whenever Banor led them, but then the mighty human champion could not be everywhere, and those human armies that went into battle without him were vanquished by the dark hordes all too often. who was in fact a demigod, was to live for many centuries.

        "text":"Finally, Banor again turned to the gods to help him, and they answered his prayers. Again it was the ever-resourceful Uman who had found a solution, a solution that was possible because he had made the most amazing discovery: He had found that beyond the very fabric of existence there were other dimensions, far-away planes in which even the elder gods held no power. However, Uman had found a way to establish a connection to these alternative planes of existence, and after much experimentation he had learned that it was possible to conjure souls of living creatures from these planes. When brought to Tibia these souls could be turned into human shape, forming the champions the human race desperately needed. This, then, was the answer to the human's problems, and it was swiftly put into practice. The gods planted a number of magical gates on Tibia, gates that were soon referred to as Portals of Souls. Through these gates a steady flow of heroes came into the world, human warriors that were both cunning and brave, and with the aid of these champions the abominable hordes were slowly but surely pushed back. At the long last it looked as though the order would be restored. Things looked brighter for the human race than they had done in a long time. The allied powers of heroes and humans advanced further and further into the enemy's territory, and the dark hordes seemed to stand on the verge of utter defeat. But alas! Those who believed that the old races would now be wiped from the face of Tibia for good were a little hasty, because something unexpected happened. Faced with the seemingly overwhelming might of the human armies the old races did what for aeons had been unthinkable: They signed a truce. Dragons, orcs, undead and all those other races that had fought amongst themselves for so long suddenly stopped attacking each other and concentrated on their war against the human race. And so it came to pass that again things took a turn for the worse. Even though their enemies did not trust each other enough to form any alliance worth mentioning, the sheer fact that they stopped fighting amongst each other brought the human race into a very precarious position. Soon their advance was brought to halt, and once more they were forced onto the defensive. The human armies decided to withdraw to their fortified cities to resume the war there, but again they made a surprising discovery. For this time, the very first time in recorded history, the enemies of the humans did not rush after them to take up the fight. Many were puzzled by this, as it was not readily apparent why the hordes acted this way. A common theory was the tensions and the mutual distrust between the old races was too strong for them to combine their forces in a sustained campaign, and some even claimed that they had started waging war against each other once more. Others suggested that the old races had exhausted themselves in the course of the many wars, while still others hinted that perhaps an equilibrium had been reached, a status quo which all sides felt they could live with. Whatever the reason, a period of restless but fundamentally stable peace ensued, and it lasts to this day. For the very first time the troubled world has a reprieve from the ceaseless slaughter which troubled it for aeons.

They got hold of a big fish-a Venorean trader which was packed with gold, gems, finest cloth and the finest weapons and armor you can get in the whole lands of Tibia.\nPirates as they were everyone wanted the lion's share of the treasure and there was a mutiny. Klaus wrote in his diary about an unspeakable slaughtering which ended when only four of the whole crew were left. They knew they wouldn't be able to navigate the ship with less then 4 people so they made an agreement. They hid the treasure at a safe spot, made a map which was cut into four pieces. Everyone of them got one piece of the map and was told to secure the treasure with a trap...a ​​riddle...that only he knows. The names of the surviving pirates were: Nutty Jack, Rapp Scallion, Captain Nathaniel and of course, Klaus."

        "text":"We, the werelions, are the golden children and the chosen among all were creatures. We are fundamentally different from all other known were beasts: We have learned to control the Curse! In our were form, we don't turn into wild beasts that mindlessly attack anyone who comes close. Rather, we have the same control over ourselves in this form as we have as humans. We can consciously turn into our werelion form or back into human shape. Originally, we were some city guards of Darashia, who were bitten by a werelion during an expedition outside the city. The guards retired into the desert, but one of them, a man named Kalim, was so strong-willed that he managed to control the Curse. He taught the other guards to achieve this control as well. Thus, they were able to return to Darashia undetected and continued to protect the city in human form. They also set forth to find and kill all of the wild and uncontrolled werelions - with success. Gradually, they got so used to the Curse that they saw it as a gift rather than a burden. They therefore began to deliberately pass the curse on to others whom they considered worthy - and from then on no longer called it \"the Curse\" but \"the Gift\".\n\nOver time, we, the werelions, developed our own secret subculture within Darashia. At that time, we also began to fight the werehyaenas, who kept getting too close to the city. This caused the old hostility between us and them. We mostly prevailed and were able to protect Darashia. However, as our number increased, we withdrew from the city, knowing that people's fear of us would be too great to accept us as part of Darashia. We trained some human guards as a special unit of hyaena hunters to continue our task, then left the city forever. We retreated to the Lion's Rock on the northern coast of the Darama Desert. Deep beneath this rock we created the so-called Sanctum, an extensive complex that resembles a mixture of palace and temple. For a long time already, we had been not just warriors, but also scholars, artists, craftsmen and architects. A wereliness named Timandra drafted the plans for the Sanctum, and we built it under the Darama Desert over the course of many years. We created our own unique architectural style, which is of course characterized by motifs and depictions of lions, but is otherwise more reminiscent of Ankrahmun than Darashia. Another recurring motif is the connection of sun and moon: We, the werelions, see ourselves as children of the sun Suon, but are also aware of our connection to the moon, which we call Uaris. Until today, our powers are strongest at the time of the full moon. Therefore, we created mosaics in the Sanctum that show a connection between Suon and Uaris, our father and mother.

You were perfectly right, the gullible fools were so eager to engage in their heroic acts, it took almost no effort to use them for our cause. They acquired all parts of the godbreaker and risked their miserable lives willingly. If they could only appreciate our higher course in the name of Variphor! I'm glad to hear your manipulation of Ferumbras was quite a success, too. His vanity and lust for power made him the ideal candidate. All the years of work finally pay off. It must have been Variphor's might that allowed us to put all the pieces together just in time. Not only will we be able to use Ferumbras' ascension energy to open a breach for our master, we will also have just the weapon he needs, to destroy all the gods once and for all! Soon, his rule will begin! When this letter reaches you, your part of our plan will most likely also be fulfilled, and the magical energies which Ferumbras stole, gathered and accumulated all these years will be used to our ends. I would just love to see his face when he realises what is happening! I will use the coordinates you sent to open a portal to his hideout. This will force our stupid heroes to confront him in his ascension. The beauty of the plan is that they will have to engage him to prevent him from becoming a god. Regardless of their success, the energies will be used to strengthen the rift and hopefully allow the master to fully enter. If they fail, his ascension will open the breach for Variphor - if they succeed, the rogue energies will tear a breach of their own! The sudden flux of energy will leave Ferumbras more vulnerable, and so the pathetic heroes might even stand a chance. Should they fail though, Ferumbras will certainly go on a rampage, using his godly powers to cause chaos and destruction, furthering the master's hold on reality as a whole. Variphor's arrival is inevitable. I will just have to make sure to teleport away in time, before the fools arrive, and hand my servant this letter. I don't think they will ar..."

        "text":"Not by choice but the twisted laws of nature of this plane the unthings slowly became things. Though they manifested in different forms, some rough types were the most common. Probably guided by the nature of that weird place. And there, in the deep below, they became aware of each other. And they looked upon their own kind with the only feeling that they knew. The great hunger. A terrible war of extinction began beneath the surface of what would become known as the caverns of Zarganash. A fierce war that knew no mercy or remorse. And yet there was no one that could have noticed it. When the war ebbed, most of the large number of entities had dwindled significantly, but the successful competitors had become huge and bloated. The most successful of their kind had taken the shape of what mortals would call worms. They dwelt in the depths of the plane, never traveling too close to the surface, constantly looking for souls whose burden let them sink into the embrace of the depths. This was the way for many aeons. The caverns of Zarganash became a vast plane, filled with all the lost or those in denial. Occasional travelers would pass by and leave their mark, some of the souls that were bound to the plane even retained or regained their consciousness. Most of the latter would pass into the afterlife but others took it upon them to stay. Some of them with good, others with more evil purposes. Occasionally a mighty necromancer would rip a rift into the realm, in their attempts to enslave the lost souls for their own sinister purposes but for a long time the caverns were quiet and solemn as it was fit for a sub-plane of death. I was one of the souls lost in their own suffering. Once a great scientist, there was so much left to do at the time of my untimely death. Remorse and self-loathing would have torn me apart eventually, a feast for the worms. But I met my master and teacher, or better, he found me. He managed to break the cycles of thoughts that entrapped me and made me aware of my state. Over time he even taught me how to let go and free myself from the burden I thought to carry. He taught me about the caverns of Zarganash, what he and his predecessors had learned and schooled me in the various philosophies he studied under his own mentors. When he finally decided to move on, I stayed to carry on his work and do my best to help others who are lost. Time means little here so I can't tell how long I hardened but recently things started to change. Something weakened the barriers between worlds and planes. Our plane fared no better. More and more of the lost souls pour out into the world of mortals. Some of the lost seemingly even stumbled into the afterlife by chance and I dread what fate might await those unprepared or what havoc they might cause at places they were never meant to be. However, bigger threats are arising. Even in our planes the barriers are falling and the hungry worms are on the move, all too eager to devour. That would be alarming enough but things recently got much, much worse.

        "text":"The pale worm was thought by most of us to be a mere legend, an allegory, and for all I know it might have been that way for a long time. He is the embodiment of the hunger and the feeling of unfulfillment that is present in this plane. I can't tell what this thing truly is. It might very well just be the biggest and most powerful incarnation of the hungry worms, the one that has devoured so many souls and others of its kind so huge, bloated and powerful that it is on the verge of becoming a demigod of this plane. Or if it is the avatar of the hunger that is inherited to this plane. A spiritual creation of all the ambitions and scorn that became some kind of god of the lost dead without their conscious participation. Perhaps though, the pale worm is something entirely different and foreign. Be it as it may, what at some time has been some allegorical threat has certainly become a real one. Even worse, he is worshiped by some of the most deprived souls that this plane harbors. Twisted by their inner darkness, those souls found even more power in their service of the worm. I dare not to meddle with such tainted beings nor would they be eager to tell me about their affairs so I can only make assumptions, based on hearsay and the weak evidence I could gather. It hints that with the appearance of the pale worm some of the most corrupted begun to worship and serve the worm. It seemingly had enough sentience by then, to spare them. In turn the worm received more sentience and even intelligence from the reverence they bestowed him with. Even more so the worm now feeds not only on the souls that were already in the phase of dissipating but on fresh and just arrived souls his cultists feed him. All of this gave the worm not only a twisted form of sentience but also a purpose, though what this ultimately may be I can not tell. For now it seems he is in the process of devouring each and everything on the plane and will eventually BECOME the plane, immediately feeding on the souls that arrive here, even only in passing. But the hunger can't be ended or even blunted. It will drive the worm to devour more and more, eventually threathen everything with its growing power. I will try to learn more about it's machinations and confront one of his minions from him, perhaps I might learn more. But I fear their power. They were some of the strongest souls here even before they pledged themselves to the worm and I don't know what powers and gifts they acquired from their dread master. In case I don't return, these notes might give some insight and warning to any seeker of such knowlegde."

        "text":"Zarganash is a word from an ancient language that outlived its creators. It describes a complicated state of a place that wasn't meant to be or does not really exist, yet defies this nonetheless by 'being there in a certain way'. The whole concept is warped in convoluted philosophy and metaphysics modern researches still try to figure out, causing heated debates in informed circles. Marginalised as a fringe philosophy, the concept gained new prominence when necromancers adopted it for their own purposes. In a time when even death was young, the caverns of Zarganash were just a place without much dimension and reality, where some of the souls of the dead rested for the length of an afterthought before they passed into the great beyond and whatever might await them there. In the aeons to come myriads of souls of all kinds passed by and went on. Now and then a soul was not willing to depart the mortal world and tried to anchor them in the Zarganash. Over time the place that wasn't a place also harbored more and more souls that lost their way in despair, neglection or defiance. The formless doorstep to the afterlife gained substance and dimension by the mere presence of the lost souls. If became a bleak reflection of their despair, formed from the residue of undefined desires. The souls would stay there without finding any rest and were slowly torn apart by their own regrets and a hunger for all the things they felt they were denied in life. These feelings weighed heavily and seeped deep into the ground and base of the nascent plane. Deep down where the reality of the plane bordered the void of nothingness these dark hungers, eager to devour themselves, clustered. Over time entities emerged that were born from these hunger clusters. They were unformed, without sentience and without shape or purpose. The one thing they had was their insatiable hunger. So they began to actively devour the souls whose burden let them sink so low, that the hungering unthings could reach them. Following the stream of souls upwards, the devouring menance slowly over the course of centuries, even aeons, ascended. But the plane had changed too. The torn feeling of countless souls had formed a bleak world that had gained some reality on its own. The physicality of the world above kept the undefined hungering entities away, at least for a while. Over time entities emerged that were born from these hunger clusters.
