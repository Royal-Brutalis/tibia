Skjaar: Another creature who believes thinks physical strength is more important than wisdom! Why are you disturbing me?  
Player: Door  
Skjaar: This door seals a crypt.  
Player: Job  
Skjaar: Once I was the master of all mages, but now I only protect this crypt.  
Player: Crypt  
Skjaar: Here lies my master. Only his closest followers may enter.  
Player: Master  
Skjaar: If you are one of his followers, you need not ask about him, for you will know. And if you aren't, you are not worthy anyway!  
Player: Time  
Skjaar: To those who have lived for a thousand years time holds no more terror.  
Player: Castle  
Skjaar: The castle was destroyed when my master tried to summon a nameless creature. All that is left is this volcano.  
Player: Volcano  
Skjaar: I can still feel the magical energy in the volcano.  
Player: Bye  
Skjaar: Farewell, Player!
