Player: hi  
Captain Kurt: How cute, a freshly hatched newcomer. Harr. Can’t leave this island without a vocation, y’know? Y’should talk to the four vocation masters first, Player.  
Player: vocation  
Captain Kurt: Ya must have one if ya wanna leave here. Need some power before going to the main continent, aye!  
Player: main  
Captain Kurt: Y’chose a peaceful world. Ain’t much danger from other guys. Just beware the monsters, y’know. Wanna go there, ask fo’ a passage.  
Player: passage  
Captain Kurt: Nope, yer not going anywhere. Can’t transport ya without a vocation, y’know?  
Player: masters  
Captain Kurt: Lemme get this right, ahum. Estrella, Hykrion, Narai and Yandur. Aye, that’s it.  
Player: Estrella  
Captain Kurt: Scary lady. Makes me feel sorta stupid at times. Talk t’her for sorcerer info.  
Player: sorcerer  
Captain Kurt: Turns out pretty powerful in the end.  
Player: Hykrion  
Captain Kurt: Harr. My training partner, aye. Talk t’him for knight info.  
Player: knight  
Captain Kurt: Rock solid vocation. Easy t’play, hard t’master.  
Player: Narai  
Captain Kurt: Harrrrrrrrrr. Nuff said. Talk t’her for paladin info.  
Player: paladin  
Captain Kurt: I prefer t’have my enemies closer to my face than those distance fighters. Harrr.  
Player: Yandur  
Captain Kurt: Can be nice t’have a healer around. Talk t’him for druid info.  
Player: druid  
Captain Kurt: Decent vocation. Healing’s always nice.  
Player: kurt  
Captain Kurt: Hrm?  
Player: ship  
Captain Kurt: She’s pretty, ain’t she? Will bring ya almost anywhere. Though a young seadog such as you should consider to travel to Venore first. The traver is fo’ free. Just once though! Gotta ask fo’ a passage.  
Player: venore  
Captain Kurt: Harrr, one of the richest cities, filled with merchants. It is EXTREMELY recommendable for unexperienced adventurers. Dunno though why they built it over a stinking swamp though. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: sail  
Captain Kurt: Nope, yer not going anywhere. Can’t transport ya without a vocation, y’know?  
Player: thais  
Captain Kurt: Old-school city. Actually the oldest main city in Tibia. Be careful on those streets, there’re bandits everywhere. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: carlin  
Captain Kurt: A city ruled by crazy amazon women! Blimey! Depends on yer taste whether ya think that’s good or not. Harr. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: ab’dendriel  
Captain Kurt: Ab… Den… wha’ever, I never get that spelling right. Main city of the elves, lots of trees ‘n stuff. Very cosy and safe I guess if yer fond of nature. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: edron  
Captain Kurt: Only for premium travellers! Quiet little castle city on an island in the north-eastern part of Tibia. Good place for starters, really. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: premium  
Captain Kurt: Some regions in the world can’t be accessed by everyone. Gotta pay, y’know? If y’spend some real cash fo’ premium time, I can bring ya t’much cooler locations.  
Player: ankrahmun  
Captain Kurt: Only for premium travellers! Desert pyramid city close to the ocean, far too hot and dry for my taste. But word is there are good hunting grounds nearby. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: darashia  
Captain Kurt: Only for premium travellers! One of the two desert cities. Built around an oasis. Decent location for a newcomer. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: liberty bay  
Captain Kurt: Only for premium travellers! Liberty Bay is on an island group in the South Seas. Pirates ‘n stuff, y’know. Gotta be careful, but good hunting location. I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: kazordoon  
Captain Kurt: The underground dwarven city. Doesn’t have a real harbour, so I can’t bring ya there, y’know.  
Player: port hope  
Captain Kurt: Only for premium travellers! Port Hope is an outpost right in the middle of the jungle. Who’d want to go there?? Except for really crazy adventurers? I can sail there if ya like.  
Player: yalahar  
Captain Kurt: Now that must be one o’ the biggest cities I’ve ever seen. Might be not cosy for a newcomer like yerself though. And I can’t sail there anyway… they don’t let everyone enter their fine pretty harbour, y’know.  
Player: roshamuul  
Captain Kurt: Dangerous area, for sure. Far too dangerous for someone like you. A place of demons and nightmares they say. The inquisition would never allow me to drop you into your sure death.  
Player: krailos  
Captain Kurt: That’s a faraway grassland, inhabited by savage ogres.  
Player: rathleton  
Captain Kurt: Curious place for sure. Full of strange machines and monsters. Would be quite dangerous for ye’. I don’t know who to traverse the treacherous reefs around the isle anyway.  
Player: svargrond  
Captain Kurt: Nah, can’t bring ya there. Those nordic barbarians have their own rules of who they wanna let live in their city. But go there sometime, heard it’s quite interesting.  
Player: rookgaard  
Captain Kurt: Nah, y’dun wanna go back there.  
Player: adventurers guild  
Captain Kurt: Those ol’ dogooders are tryin’ to help ya whelps to get a grasp of adventurin’. With the adventurer’s stone you can reach their guild hall from all major temples. …  
Captain Kurt: I strongly advice ya to travel there as soon as possible.  
Player: leave  
Captain Kurt: Nope, yer not going anywhere. Can’t transport ya without a vocation, y’know?  
Player: continent  
Captain Kurt: Y’chose a peaceful world. Ain’t much danger from other guys. Just beware the monsters, y’know. Wanna go there, ask fo’ a passage.  
Player: tibia  
Captain Kurt: That’s how the whole place is called.  
Player: travel  
Captain Kurt: Nope, yer not going anywhere. Can’t transport ya without a vocation, y’know?  
Player: bye / farewell  
Captain Kurt: Hrrrm. Better y’stay here for a bit, aight.
