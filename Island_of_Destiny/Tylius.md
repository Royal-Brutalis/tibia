Player: hi  
Tylius: Hello there! I see you had fun in the close combat tent, that's great! Now, this is the distance fighting tent. In here, you can test staffs that sorcerers and druids use. Want to give it a go? Say yes.  
Player: yes  
Tylius: Hahah, eager to roast some party skeletons, eh? Still, sorcerer and druids are distance fighters. That means they do NOT touch the monsters. Mainly because their defense and armor is a lot weaker. On the other hand, their damage output is far greater ...  
Tylius: You need to find the right distance. If too far away, the staff won't work; if too close, you will receive a heavy beating from the monster. First, EQUIP your new staff in the WEAPON SLOT in your inventory, ...  
Tylius: then RIGHT-CLICK on a monster on the map or battle list and choose 'ATTACK'. ...  
Tylius: Remember that a staff like this also USES MANA, so make sure you grab some FOOD and eat it. You can find food in the chest on the way to the next tent as well as some blueberry bushes. Mana will only be regenerated inside tents. ...  
Tylius: Ready for the staff?  
Player: Ready  
Tylius: Alright, here you go! Have fun with the staff. Don't forget that you need to drag your staff from the inventory to your weapon slot. If you've had enough, just go to the next tent!
