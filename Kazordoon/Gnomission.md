Player: Hi  
Gnomission: Hello Player. You are probably eager to enter the warzones.  
Player: Warzones  
Gnomission: There are three warzones. In each warzone you will find fearsome foes. At the end you'll find their mean master. The masters is well protected though. ...  
Gnomission: Make sure to talk to our gnomish agent in there for specifics of its' protection. ...  
Gnomission: Oh, and to be able to enter the second warzone you have to beat the first. To enter the third you have to beat the second. ...  
Gnomission: And you can enter each one only once every twenty hours. Your normal teleport crystals won't work on these teleporters. You will have to get mission crystals from Gnomally.  
Player: Job  
Gnomission: I am responsible for our war missions. You have to be rank 4 to enter the warzones.  
Player: Name  
Gnomission: I am Gnomission. I am responsible for our war missions. You have to be rank 4 to enter the warzones.  
Player: Gnomes  
Gnomission: We gnomes are masters of growing and working crystals and we also mastered the raising of a variety of mushrooms for different purposes.  
Player: Missions  
Gnomission: You are already allowed to enter the warzones. There is nothing I can do for you. Get a mission crystal from Gnomally and better find some friends to join you.  
Player: Crystals  
Gnomission: Ah you are amazed by our crystals, aren't you? Well, you have only seen a tiny fraction of what they are able to do.  
Player: Mushrooms  
Gnomission: In the last century mushrooms have become more and more important for producing raw materials and tools and less important for sustenance.  
Player: Bye  
Gnomission: Good bye!
