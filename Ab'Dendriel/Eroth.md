Player: Hi  
Eroth: I greet thee, outsider.  
Player: Job  
Eroth: I am the leader of the Cenath caste.  
Player: Magic  
Eroth: Magic comes almost naturally to the Cenath. We keep the secrets of ages.  
Player: Spell  
Eroth: I can teach the spells 'magic shield', 'destroy field', 'creature illusion', 'chameleon', 'convince creature', and 'summon creature'.  
Player: Kuridai  
Eroth: The Kuridai are aggressive and victims of their instincts. Without our help they would surely die in a foolish war.  
Player: Deraisim  
Eroth: They lack the understanding of unity. We are keeping them together and prevent them from being slaughtered one by one.  
Player: Cenath  
Eroth: We are the shepherds of our people. The other castes need our guidance.  
Player: Crunor  
Eroth: Gods are for the weak. We will master the world on our own. We need no gods.  
Player: Bye  
Eroth: Asha Thrazi. Go, where you have to go.
